<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They land on Ganyu’s desk with a sharp and unceremonious </span><em><span class="s2">clink!</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Here,” says the Yuheng in that crisp, businesslike manner of hers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu takes a moment to blink at the item— a pair of brass keys and a small, bejeweled ornament in the shape of a feather attached to a ring— and has to purse her lips to bite down her irritation. “With all due respect, Lady Yuheng, while I’m aware that it must be very rare for you to see me outside of work, I can </span><em><span class="s2">assure</span></em><span class="s1"> you that I do, in fact, have a home to which I most happily return most nights.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing pinches the bridge of her nose and sighs, her brow furrowing in equal annoyance. “That’s not what they’re for,” she says. “They’re a set of spare keys to my house.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu eyes the key ring, as if it will clarify things. “…I beg your pardon?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this, Keqing rolls up her sleeve and points to an ugly, fading bruise around her shoulder. “I slipped and tumbled down a gully while on a land survey the other day,” she explains. “As you know, I intend to hold this position for the foreseeable future, and it therefore follows that there are still a great many land surveys I will have to conduct someday, each of which carries with it a certain risk of injury. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am more than willing to accept that risk, as I am more than capable of performing first aid on myself while in the field, but recently I’ve realized there’s a chance I may receive an injury which could prevent me from coming to work for a while. Therefore, I decided to prepare a set of spare keys to allow a designated coworker to drop off any relevant work updates as a contingency plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As expected of Keqing, it’s a well-thought plan grounded in practicality.  </span><em><span class="s2">But…</span></em><span class="s1"> “I suppose I just don’t understand why you chose me,” Ganyu admits. </span><em><span class="s2">Shouldn’t you choose a coworker you’d actually </span></em><span class="s1">like</span><em><span class="s2"> to see when you’re injured?</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing makes a flatly displeased sort of expression. “My assistant turnover is too high to make them a viable option,” she says, then wrinkles her nose a bit. “And I don’t want to just </span><em><span class="s2">hand</span></em><span class="s1"> my house keys over to Ningguang like that. After the incident with the Lucent Crescents, I </span><em><span class="s2">refuse</span></em><span class="s1"> to trust her with anything outside of </span><em><span class="s2">strictly</span></em><span class="s1"> professional endeavors held within the absolute bounds of Yujing Terrace.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(Ganyu stifles a laugh.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I know you and I have had our disagreements before, but.. ultimately, you’re the most reliable coworker I have,” Keqing continues. “You’re perceptive and detail-oriented, and you follow routine like clockwork. If I fail to show up one day after a scheduled expedition, I feel like I can count on you to notice and check in.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The suppressed giggle fully fades from Ganyu’s throat as Keqing then pushes the keys closer to her.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><em><span class="s2">So that’s how it is.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She wonders just how long Keqing must have had this idea kept on the backburner for want of a trustworthy coworker— Ganyu herself is certain that, had Keqing thrown the same proposition at her just a few months ago, she would have politely declined: They don’t get along, and so she has no desire to pay extra visits to the woman who has only blasphemies to say.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, things have changed in the Qixing offices since the fall of Rex Lapis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu picks up the keyring and considers it for a moment. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">((She remembers what Res Lapis said about the Yuheng not long before he passed.))</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The seasons are changing in Liyue. Although her faith in the woman is still brittle, Ganyu, for the first time in many a millennia, decides to see if maybe things can change between the two of them, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“All right,” she says, and she adds the ring of keys to her own. “I hope I should never have to use them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Interestingly enough, Keqing cracks a smile. “That </span><em><span class="s2">would</span></em><span class="s1"> be the best-case scenario,” she agrees. “But at least now I’m more prepared for the worst.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">Perhaps I should have asked Rex Lapis for her safety,</span></em><span class="s1"> Ganyu thinks wryly to herself only a few months later, as she sifts through the dozens of keys in her work-related collection, for that </span><em><span class="s2">hard-headed</span></em><span class="s1"> Yuheng has gone and cracked a rib while helping with the reconstruction of Liyue Harbor. It’s a silly thought (one she knows would be ill-received by the woman in question), but there really is no better way to express the way her (very human) petty frustrations currently intersect with her (rather qilin) desires for simple peace and prosperity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, she agreed to do this, and so Ganyu takes a deep breath as she faces down the wrought-iron gate guarding Keqing’s home. With the correct pair of keys finally in her hands, she lets herself into Keqing’s property, marches up to the front door—</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">…and pauses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(Should she knock to announce her arrival, or should she simply… </span><em><span class="s2">let herself in</span></em><span class="s1">?)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the end, Ganyu settles for something in-between. “Lady Yuheng,” she calls as she wrestles with the lock. “I brought the dossiers you requested.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The front door lock is infinitely fussier than the gate had been, which makes Ganyu feel somewhat like a criminal when she hears a shuffling sound, followed by a few sharp hisses, come from inside the house. </span><em><span class="s2">Hopefully it’s just a cat…</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, it is not a cat who greets her once the door is open, but the Yuheng herself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Ganyu,” Keqing greets with a wince. “I appreciate your punctuality.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu bows her head. “Your assistant helped me finish my regular tasks after filing your injury report,” she explains simply. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A brief, yet awkward pause follows. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Well, let’s not waste any more time,” Keqing briskly says. “Let me get you some sandals so you can come inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before Ganyu can politely tell Keqing not to strain herself, the other woman blinks out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Here,” Keqing says when she returns less than ten seconds later to toss a pair of house slippers into the entryway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a moment, Ganyu thinks the Yuheng is looking down on her, but the ancient memory of an enemy’s heavy weapon striking her side rises from the depths of her history to keep her tongue in check. As Ganyu changes out of her office heels, Keqing walks a short ways away, then gestures her to follow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I apologize for making you carry the documents all this way. Normally, I’d take them from here, but considering the scope of the project…” Keqing trails off as they enter a beautiful study room, then sighs. (She grimaces once again.) “Well, Dr. Baizhu said to wait a few days before even </span><em><span class="s2">thinking</span></em><span class="s1"> of doing any heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s no trouble at all,” Ganyu replies, and it’s true: she carries the hefty box of documents in her arms as easily as a mule and sets it down without complaint when Keqing taps the immaculate surface of a polished cuihua wood desk. “Now, if that’s all you needed help with, Lady Keqing, I will see myself out.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She doesn’t expect it in the slightest when Keqing asks her to wait.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’d like to discuss some thoughts with you regarding the reopening of the Bishui Trade Route, if you have a moment,” Keqing tells her. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu gives her an odd look. Now </span><em><span class="s2">that’s</span></em><span class="s1"> a name she hasn’t heard in a long time. “Rex Lapis closed Bishui Trade Route well over a thousand years ago,” she says. </span><em><span class="s2">And for good reason.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Yes, when raids by the local dissidents made its maintenance an unjustifiable cost,” Keqing argues, “but there are no such dissidents in Liyue today. Treasure hoarders, perhaps, but they exist on nowhere near the same scale of danger as the various local militias common to the areas surrounding Dihua Marsh at that time, as they lack the latter’s strong sense of political conviction. The Millelith can handle them easily.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(</span><em><span class="s2">That is true,</span></em><span class="s1"> Ganyu must begrudgingly admit.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“With the Harbor still undergoing major reconstruction, I’ve been receiving reports from Yilong Wharf lately regarding their struggle to handle the prolonged increase in mercantile ships anchoring there,” Keqing continues, “so I’ve been thinking a lot about how we can diversify our trading options, as it’s become quite painfully obvious from the Osial Incident that Liyue Harbor serving as the center of both our politics and our commerce makes it our nation’s greatest single point of failure. And although I expect the docks will be rebuilt enough to reopen the city to port trade by Moonchase, I still find myself wondering… </span><em><span class="s2">‘What would Rex Lapis do?’</span></em><span class="s1">”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">((The realization hits Ganyu all at once: </span><em><span class="s2">and so you want to trust what I know.</span></em><span class="s1">))</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point, Keqing reaches to grab something from a nearby upper shelf, only to recoil halfway, doubling over with a hiss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Are you all right?” Ganyu asks with alarm, rushing to Keqing’s side before she knows it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Keqing grumbles, hand pressed to her side. “I just moved a bit too quickly. Can you grab me that map on the topmost shelf?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Of course.” But first, Ganyu takes an old, silk handkerchief from her pocket, carefully summons a handful of Cryo chunks, and discreetly hands it to Keqing. Then, she stands on her tiptoes to pluck the requested map from its perch above their heads and hands that off to Keqing, too. “You were saying?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Thank you,” Keqing grunts (though, that’s not what Ganyu’s looking for), and once she smooths out the incredibly detailed map between them, she holds the ice pack to her side with a quiet sigh of relief. With her free hand, she pulls a worn-out pin from her hair, and she points to Qingce Village and traces the long path down to Liyue Harbor. “As I’m sure you know, the original Bishui Trade Route was primarily used as a method of transporting goods made and grown in Qingce to the Harbor…”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The moon is high in the sky by the time Ganyu leaves Keqing’s home, her entire work day and then some spent first arguing, then later reconsidering and further discussing, all the sides to each of their proposed adjustments to the historical Bishui Trade Route, from the long-term costs of trying to control the river’s course to the political benefits of having a safer route to Mondstadt, their oldest allied nation. And as she takes a moment to pause by the front gate and gaze at the brilliant moon, all of Ganyu’s scattered thoughts swirl together in her head.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">Perhaps she’s not so incomprehensible after all.</span></em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moonchase comes and goes. The next time she visits Keqing’s house, it is because she feels an absence in the office which hadn’t been there before when Keqing would take her occasional days off, one which brings not the easy relief it once had, but instead a sense of quiet disappointment. When the rest of the Qixing spend the day discussing the current situation in the Chasm, and Ganyu just can’t help but to find a critical </span><em><span class="s2">something</span></em><span class="s1"> missing without Keqing’s firsthand experience working in its mines.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(Just like the moon, so too does Ganyu’s relationship with the Yuheng continue to change.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I hope you don’t mind, but I brought some vegetables I found on the way back from Bubu Pharmacy,” Ganyu announces when delivering a dose of cough medicine. “We can eat them while we finalize your formal comments on today’s meeting minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Keqing asks, and Ganyu can’t tell if the woman looks more ill from the day spent cooped up at home or the thought of taking Dr. Baizhu’s bitter concoction without a spoonful of sugar to help it go down. “What kind of vegetables?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Yam leaves,” Ganyu answers as she sets her basket of them on Keqing’s kitchen counter. She sighs, half nostalgia and half daydream. “I wish they sold them at the market, but they go bad so quickly…”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing looks at her oddly. “Just the leaves?” she asks, quite obviously baffled as she cranes her neck to look over Ganyu’s shoulder. “Are those… edible?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“</span><em><span class="s2">I</span></em><span class="s1"> ate them growing up,” Ganyu absently replies as she washes the dirt from the vines with care. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The skepticism remains on Keqing’s face, but she downs her medicine and gets to work rinsing the rice. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(She always does this when Ganyu helps with chores on her visits, no matter how sick she is. Although Ganyu initially didn’t care all that much, she had, at one point, mentioned to Keqing that she was perfectly capable of taking care of an unwell person’s chores on her own, only for Keqing to </span><em><span class="s2">insist</span></em><span class="s1"> on her own participation.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s3">((“Our agreement is for work and work alone, so if you’re going to cook, then I need to contribute, too. Even if I’m sick, it isn’t fair for you to handle all my chores when you have no duty of care towards me.”))</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">But I </span></em><span class="s4">do</span><em><span class="s2"> have a duty of care to Liyue and her people. Are you not also one of Liyue’s people?</span></em><span class="s1"> Ganyu wonders, and the lurch in her chest at the thought makes her realize she’s slowed down compared to Keqing, now picking out a few choice cloves of garlic to prep since the rice is in the steamer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Soon enough, their dinner is on the table with a detailed Chasm map beneath their bowls, protected from their dinner by a pane of tempered glass, to aid in their discussion and review of the Tianshu’s proposed unsealing plan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Keqing briefly makes a face once they start digging in, and so Ganyu cannot help but to ask— </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a little bitter, don’t you think?” Keqing asks. “Are you sure you cooked it long enough?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu blinks at her as she takes another bite herself. Yes, the dish is faintly bitter when compared to a vegetable as sweet as, say, spinach, but otherwise… “No more than usual,” she replies, politely covering her mouth to hide the way she chews. “It tastes just the way I like it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing grunts and takes another bite. “It isn’t </span><em><span class="s2">bad</span></em><span class="s1">; it just doesn’t taste quite how I expected,” she admits a moment later. “After all, sweet potatoes are— well— </span><em><span class="s2">sweet</span></em><span class="s1">.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu hums. “I suppose even when I was young, most people preferred the roots,” she agrees, then takes another bite in the pause which follows. “But those who lived would endure these bitter flavors without fear.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The beautiful aftertaste blooms on her tongue in the silence they then share.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You garden, right?” Keqing eventually asks. “Why not grow your own yams?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Not enough space in my yard,” Ganyu admits. “I already grow plenty of things, and I’m not home enough to justify buying a bigger plot to tend in my free time… This simple life I’ve cultivated for myself is fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She finishes off the last of her rice, and she plods off to wash her bowl.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spring cleaning before Lantern Rite is a tradition nearly as old as the holiday itself, but Ganyu is still surprised when Keqing asks for help with it. Ganyu understands she is the obvious choice, having held the keys to her home for a year and some change now, but it still feels odd when she agrees to the duty, as if it were somehow still too soon for them to cross that line from </span><em><span class="s2">professional</span></em><span class="s1"> into </span><em><span class="s2">personal</span></em><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">(But… even if the flowers have still yet to bloom in Yujing Terrace, is that not what has been growing between them as of late?)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m going to haul this batch of books down to Wanwen for Jifang to appraise,” Keqing shouts from the bottom of the staircase. “Feel free to move on to the next room when you’re done in the study.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Understood!” Ganyu calls back, and she returns to humming an old folk tune to herself. Most of what remains (nominally) unsorted in the Yuheng’s study are her rocks and her notebooks, each of which has its own set of curios about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu is a bit of a nosy creature, to be quite honest (if not by nature, then most </span><em><span class="s2">certainly</span></em><span class="s1"> by nurture), and the insights a quick flip through the Yuheng’s notebook would provide tug alluringly at her mind. Although she certainly knows Keqing much better now than she could have previously even imagined…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">I still wonder what goes through her mind sometimes.</span></em><span class="s1"> She delicately picks up a leather-bound book with a faded label. </span><em><span class="s2">I want to know what she thinks of…</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She shakes her head and returns the notebook to its unsorted pile. </span><em><span class="s2">No, even if her thoughts on me have changed— even if </span></em><span class="s1">my</span><em><span class="s2"> thoughts on </span></em><span class="s1">her</span><em><span class="s2"> have changed— that doesn’t mean…</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She dares not finish that thought. Instead, she picks up a rock.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s a perfectly normal grey rock, the sort of thing she imagines she could pick up in any quarry surrounding the Chasm, if she wanted. Her ancient callouses, formed from centuries of bow and paper work, rasp against the stone’s coarse surface as she plays with its slight heft in her hands.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu then spots an old, sun-browned note half-buried in the box of rocks nearest her, and, hoping for some organizational insight or instruction, she tugs it free. Yet, once she unfolds it and smooths out its sharp crinkles, she is greeted not by Keqing’s swift, scribbled shorthand, but instead someone else’s calligraphy. There, written in an unfamiliar hand that is nonetheless full of life, pride, and vigor:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><em><span class="s2">A stone from another mountain can be used to carve jade.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She stares at the line— a proverb referencing the </span><em><span class="s2">Classic of Poetry</span></em><span class="s1">, no less!— for more than a few long moments. She remembers Rex Lapis once quoted it to her, too, when she complained to him of the new Yuheng’s out-of-pocket attitude, how </span><em><span class="s2">annoying</span></em><span class="s1"> it was to have that terrible woman’s insolent remarks grate against her ears all day. It was one of those rare moments when she </span><em><span class="s2">did</span></em><span class="s1"> understand the wisdom her Lord bestowed upon her; yet, she wanted nothing to do with the change it encouraged of her. She is the Secretary of the Qixing, after all: do the annals not need a steady voice and stable hand to read and write their records?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The stone sparkles faintly as the mid-afternoon sun drapes its waning winter light over the room. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Long, long ago, she remembers using something like this to kill a man. Around this time last year, she had no thoughts about where she’d be when the next year rolled around, for despite the shifting sands within the hourglass, the Qixing were all the same to her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">((What difference is there between the Ganyu of back then and the Ganyu of right now?))</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She folds up the note, somberly places it atop the stack of notebooks, then gets to work carefully sorting through Keqing’s rocks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s not long before Keqing herself returns, and Ganyu asks her about the note.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Keqing, with a tone that seems to cradle the softer emotions within her voice, “that’s from my grandfather.” She looks over the note with a smile, then laughs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What’s so funny?” Ganyu asks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Just thinking about how often I’ve needed this advice throughout my life,” Keqing admits as she creases the note just as crisply as Ganyu had first found it and tucks it into her pocket. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu feels the corner of her mouth twitch as she smothers a smile of her own. “Well, I won’t pretend I’ve never seen just how hard-headed the current Yuheng can be,” she playfully remarks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing flashes her a grin in return, and the sudden emotion which jolts through Ganyu at the sight is </span><em><span class="s2">electric</span></em><span class="s1">. “And I won’t pretend I’ve never experienced how incredibly stubborn the Secretary can be, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They both burst out laughing, and it feels like one of the moments that can’t help but to give one pause when looking through old scrapbooks, as the memory etches itself perfectly into Ganyu’s very soul.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two of them are waiting at Yanshang Teahouse, eating appetizers and sipping tea as they wait for Uncle Tian when Keqing first feels sharply ill, then spits blood into a napkin with a quiet lurch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu’s own blood freezes. Yelan owns the place </span><em><span class="s2">now</span></em><span class="s1">, sure, but she’s mentioned before that the establishment still needs a bit of weeding to be rid of some of the more cleverly-hidden dissenters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“</span><em><span class="s2">Keqing</span></em><span class="s1">,” she says, keeping a low voice so as not to draw attention to their table.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“</span><em><span class="s2">There’s rat poison in the shrimp</span></em><span class="s1">,” Keqing murmurs in reply, her breathing steady, but deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu sets her jaw. </span><em><span class="s2">So it’s targeted.</span></em><span class="s1"> She scans the area on high alert, but unfortunately, she spots nothing out of the ordinary from the other patrons, even when using her Elemental Sight. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She locks eyes with Keqing, whose expression shifts to stony resolve.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">There’s no time to investigate.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They stand up and excuse themselves, asking Chuyi to inform Uncle Tian of their departure then heading straight for Bubu Pharmacy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><span class="s2">(Halfway there, Keqing starts to slow, almost imperceptibly so, and Ganyu reaches out to take her hand.)</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plaza is blessedly empty as they approach; yet when they arrive at the pharmacy— </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m sorry; Dr. Baizhu isn’t in this week,” Herbalist Gui sheepishly tells the women.  “Are you looking to buy some medicine?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before anyone can speak, Keqing abruptly snatches an empty paper bag and hurls, her legs giving out underneath her at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Lady Keqing!” Herbalist Gui shouts in alarm, swiftly exiting the space behind the counter while Ganyu rushes to support her.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing says nothing, briefly heaving in vain into the bag, and Ganyu realizes with dropping horror how faint and wan the other woman’s face has already become. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><em><span class="s5">((Anxiety poisons her throat.))</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“</span><strong><span class="s3">Where is Dr. Baizhu</span></strong><span class="s1">?” Ganyu nearly fails to recognize the voice which falls from her own mouth, so long has it been since she’s used such iron force. Yet, with Keqing in her arms, breathing labored and eyes quickly glazing over, </span><em><span class="s2">she seems to have no other voice.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He’s visiting the elderly in Qingce Village with Qiqi,” Herbalist Gui explains, and in less than an instant, Ganyu is out the door with the semi-conscious Yuheng carried on her back.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not long after, a pale blue qilin dashes into the clouds just outside the gates of Liyue Harbor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu wakes up the next day at her usual time by an unusual bedside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Good morning,” a familiar voice says.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The last dreamy wisps of sleep flee from Ganyu’s mind as, startled, she looks wildly around the room and discovers an uncomfortable crick in her neck. “Huh—? </span><em><span class="s2">Oh</span></em><span class="s1">.” She spots the Yuheng sitting at a pine wood table by the bedroom window, nursing a cup of tea. (She feels all at once as though crystalflies have spawned inside her chest.) “Good morning, Lady Keqing. You seem well.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing gives her a wry smile. “If this had happened about a year ago, I’d have thought you were being sarcastic,” she says. “Heck, I’d probably have thought you were the one to have poisoned me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Funny how times change,” Ganyu quietly agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A pleasant silence hangs between them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When we first met,” Ganyu finds herself confessing, “I thought you were stupid.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keqing sputters on her tea. </span><em><span class="s2">“I beg your pardon?”</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just couldn’t understand why you were so unhappy with the Liyue Rex Lapis built— </span><em><span class="s2">with the Liyue </span></em><em><span class="s6">I</span></em><em><span class="s2"> helped build</span></em><span class="s1">.” The embers of that fury come to life within her chest. Ganyu takes a deep breath. “So I thought you were stupid, and ungrateful, and— and I couldn’t wait for you to die!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(For the first time in history, it appears to be Keqing’s turn to be left at a loss for words.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“…Which is why I hated it </span><em><span class="s2">so much</span></em><span class="s1"> when you would put your mora where your mouth is, every day of every project without fail, because it made you </span><em><span class="s2">impossible</span></em><span class="s1"> to dismiss as just another corrupt politician full of empty promises. No matter how hard I tried, I </span><em><span class="s2">had</span></em><span class="s1"> to watch as you changed the world around me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Idly, Ganyu reaches into her pocket and withdraws her set of personal keys. </span><span class="s1">“But then I started to watch you,” she says, and she starts to trace the shape of that feather ornament Keqing gave her with her house keys. “I started to see that everything you do is out of a love for Liyue that comes from a love of her people and their well-being, rather than a love of the status quo hiding behind a farcical respect for tradition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The moment I saw that— the moment I saw </span><em><span class="s2">you</span></em><span class="s1">— it felt like the first morning of a spring thaw.” </span><span class="s1">Outside, the mourning doves greet the day. “That was the moment when I realized that you were just the same as I, and I stopped simply waiting for you to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">(Yesterday is already such a blur in Ganyu’s memory, but the emotion of it all </span><strong><em><span class="s5">burns</span></em></strong><span class="s1"> at her heart.) </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s3">I love you.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The morning light reaches the window, and a pale sunbeam falls to the floor between them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s funny how things change,” Keqing says, and the dust motes dance in the light. She smiles at Ganyu.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><em><span class="s2">I love you.</span></em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu decides to join her by the window. She pours herself a cup of tea and says, “I’m happy you’re alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">~***~</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She hands them to Keqing in the late summer months after, a spare ring of her own house keys.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You’re over so often these days,” Ganyu says with a coy, knowing smile, “I just thought you should have a set, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With her usual crisp efficiency, Keqing takes the keys from her girlfriend and adds them to her own. “Of course I am,” she says, and the two women share a brief kiss. “Because I love you.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ganyu laughs, clear as a bell on a snowy winter morning. (She finds she does that a lot these days, as joy overwhelms her person.) “I’m glad,” she says, and they kiss again, longer this time. “I love you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><span class="s2">((In a life she once spent so long forgetting to live, Ganyu finds the flowers in bloom more often than ever before as the seasons have changed. Her heart has met its own, and together, they’ll make a home.))</span></em></p>
