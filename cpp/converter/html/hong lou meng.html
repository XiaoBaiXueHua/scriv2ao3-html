  <li>i pretty much interpret these couplets as being about sleeping and being in a dream
</ul>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>when you fall asleep and dream, you’re typically not aware that you are dreaming; hence, something unreal is taken for reality</li>
    <li>however, if we’re not dreaming, it feels as if we don’t exist at all. your entire existence becomes “unaware of existence” and functionally, you just don’t exist. are we dead or are we dreaming? who’s to say.</li>
    <li>in the second couplet, your dream fades and you wake up to reality, showing the waking world to be your true reality, thus defeating any question of which version you really are (in ref to zhuang zhou’s butterfly dream), and while your dreamless body doesn’t feel like it exists, you are never truly gone, as it is still there in the real world</li>
    <li>our dreams reflect the waking world; they cannot exist w/o first having experienced smth real</li>
  </ul></li>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>in the context of the fic, “that which is real was never unreal” → though it was in a dream (unreality), the love that blossomed while they were asleep was still real and still exists in the waking world</li>

  <li>zhou qi poem abt yuanchun in hong lou meng t/l by ellen widmer in <em><span class="s2">the beauty and the book</span></em>
</ul>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>“a beauty does not have a bad fate” references the common chinese phrase “a beauty has a bad fate”</li>
    <li>the accompanying illustration does not show yuanchun’s face, suggesting her role as imperial consort has deprived her of her identity as well as her girlish innocence</li>
    <li>the word for cage used in the poem implies a birdcage</li>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li>“There’s nothing in it really,” said Daiyu. “There’s really hardly anything to learn.  In Regulated Verse there are always four couplets: the “opening couplet,” the “developing couplet,” the “turning couplet,” and the “concluding couplet.”  In the two middle couplets, the “developing” and “turning” ones, you have to have tone-contrast and parallelism.  That’s to say in each of these couplets the even tones of one line have to contrast with the oblique tones in the other and vice versa. and the substantives and non-substantives have to balance each other, though if you’ve got a really good, original line it doesn’t matter all that much even if the tone-contrast and parallelism are all wrong.”
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>on good poetry, from ch. 48, translated by fawkes</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>“You’ve hit it exactly,” said Daiyu. “As a matter of fact, even the language is not of primary importance. The really important things are the ideas that lie behind it.  If the ideas that lie behind it are genuine, there’s no need to embellish the language for the poem to be a good one. That’s what they mean when they say “not letting the words harm the meaning.”</li>
