  <li>Typo in paragraph 3, &#34;hem&#34; instead of &#34;them&#34;</li>
  <li>Paragraph at the end of pg 1 going into 2, &#34;<span class="s1">anguidly running the edge of fingernails lightly over that long-numb patch of Xiao’s back where his wings would once-upon-a-time have emerged</span>&#34; sentence is too cluttered for my brain and could probably be smoothed out</li>
  <li>Last paragraph of page 2, you lose me with &#34;<span class="s1">what heat not following Venti’s burning touch instead creeping up his neck</span>&#34;, it takes a few readthroughs to get what it's supposed to mean and you also use the word &#34;touch&#34; twice (Doubling a word in the same sentence is a small pet peeve of mine, don't know how you usually do with that)</li>
  <li>&#34;<span class="s1">(Xiao thinks Venti could take a pulse against his dick from how desperately he’s throbbing.)</span>&#34; isn't a line I would have expected you to write in a million years, but I love it, no notes</li>
  <li>Last paragraph of page 3,<span class="s1"> I wouldn't put &#34;nibble&#34; with &#34;nipple&#34;</span>, personally lmao It's <em><span class="s2">very</span></em> funny, but that's not what this is aiming for</li>
  <li>I've written a similar scene of <span class="s1">Venti having to stop Xiao from putting anything in with no lube or preparation</span> in the past, the entire umbrella of Venti guiding Xiao in exploring his body is such an excellent one, but I do have a soft spot for that one if only for the potential for embarrassment on Xiao's part which Venti has to gently guide him back from. To show him that it's okay for him to make mistakes, and that he'll be forgiven for them</li>
  <li>Overall, I think the characterization is <em><span class="s2">excellent</span></em> for both of them, and while there's a bit of awkwardness with the wording in certain places the writing itself is also good. I regret to inform you that you are in fact good at sin, sorry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">————————————————</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>For lines I liked from Cazzo, you can count basically every aside of Xiao's you have in parentheses because you do such a good job with them. Especially the one where Xiao is contemplating Venti's scent just because I like that specific description and also all the times that Xiao is thinking about how badly he wants to say he loves Venti, but being unable to.</li>
  <li>I also really liked the part where Venti is drawing hearts on Xiao's cheek with dirty fingers because there's just something about that.</li>
  <li>Also the moment of Xiao being &#34;mortifyingly&#34; pleased by Venti calling him good because Xiao being embarrassed by his own praise kink is adorable</li>
  <li>———————————————————</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For reference I started reading at the beginning of the blowjob part </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>Minor nitpick, the phrasing of &#34;...as he tugs sharply at it for but half a second, but instantaneously,&#34; gets tangled up on the tongue</li>
  <li>Missing the word &#34;to&#34; in the phrase &#34;Xiao closes his eyes for the time it takes for Venti lift his face up&#34;</li>
  <li>I love the phrase &#34;with all the confidence of a sunbeam on a midsummer's day&#34;, it just sparks joy</li>
  <li>&#34;That forget they were <em><span class="s2">anything</span></em> but two mortals in bed together&#34;, clearly missed a word when rephrasing the sentence because your text was blacked out, go back and check that</li>
  <li>Just use the word taint. I don't know any other words that could be used as adjacent to perineum, which you already used, so just use taint. Be gross with it, it's fine</li>
  <li>Love the New Horny that dropped for Xiao. Can't be more detailed than that because I can't even articulate what the New Horny is either but I see it and I appreciate it</li>
  <li>I kinda hate the word &#34;emissions&#34; used in this context I'm ngl lol Just makes me think of a car's exhaust</li>
  <li><strong><em>IT'S ABOUT THE MOUTHFEEL!!!!!!!!!</em></strong><span class="s4"> (i know the joke is about trans women but i am still thinking about it and i'm delighted lol)</span></li>
  <li>He's embarrassed in his <em><span class="s2">liver????</span></em> (this isn't something i think needs to be changed i am just amused)</li>
  <li>yaaaaay demisexual xiao :D</li>
  <li>awwwwwwwww he's embarrassed. xiao it's okay it's just the mortifying ordeal. Love all of the preceding stuff about Xiao thinking about how much he wants Venti to fuck him and getting so wrecked about it. it's beautifully done</li>
