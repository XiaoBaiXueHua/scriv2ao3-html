&ldquo;HUOOOOOOO&rdquo; when they see that there&rsquo;s still like HALF A GIANT ROCK TO UNCOVER&rdquo; but then they keep hearing these sharp cracks. but nobara&rsquo;s hammer LOOKS okay, so they just keep going with it until SNAP! the handle on nobara&rsquo;s hammer breaks, and she beats up itadori until he pays her back. meanwhile, fushiguro, who has become surprisingly invested in this whole affair, summons his dogs or smth to go find him a really really big stick, and they do it, they come back with a really really big stick, and so they use that instead to leverage out the giant fucking rock together and they&rsquo;re all like &ldquo;yippee!!!&rdquo; and so they hurry back to campus with their giant rock to show gojo-sensei (aka discount kakashi), who&rsquo;s like &ldquo;hooo that&rsquo;s a nice rock kids let&rsquo;s display it in the school&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re all like &ldquo;yaaaaay&rdquo; so they clean up the rock, have a real grand time, and they put it in a place of honor until admin, the killjoys, are like &ldquo;hey, uhh, you can&rsquo;t do this&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;WHAAAAAAT? NO GOJO-SENSEI SAID WE COULD KEEP IT&rdquo; but then it&rsquo;s too late and admin has already called in a disproportionately large truck to take away the rock and they watch it go like, &ldquo;god this fucking sucks.&rdquo; itadori and nobara are weeping. fushiguro thinks this is the dumbest shit to ever grace the planet. and the senpai are like, &ldquo;is that seriously what they&rsquo;ve been up to on their day off?&rdquo; and yeah then it&rsquo;s the end. anyway they also convince fushiguro to summon some of his shikigami to help them dig up the rock, like his bunnies n dog, and then he reaches into like the fucking unknown for a crowbar he&rsquo;s happened to store in there for them to actually dig up the rock. </span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">BnHA. or JJK, but for now just b&rsquo;nha. </span><span class="c0 c1">strawberry shortcake. </span><span class="c0">todomomo, or fushinoba if the latter. momo&rsquo;s parents died suddenly or something, and she&rsquo;s trying to be strong about it, trying not to cry, but it&rsquo;s hard. todoroki wordlessly brings her strawberry shortcake and just awkwardly tries to small talk her as she eats it, confused at first. and when she starts crying over the cake, todoroki&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;shit. fuck. idk what to say. my dad&rsquo;s shitty n all, but idk how i&rsquo;d feel if he died. sorry i&rsquo;m bad at empathy. sorry i&rsquo;m just&mdash;&rdquo; and then he sighs, feeling like he fucked up, but for some reason even she doesn&rsquo;t understand, momo starts laughing. she&rsquo;s laughing because she&rsquo;s confused, she&rsquo;s so, so sad, but it&rsquo;s all so fresh, and here&rsquo;s this awkward pretty boy, bringing her cake and trying to small talk her, to give her </span><span class="c0 c1">some</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sense of normalcy in a time where she feels so lost, like she has nowhere to go for advice, and there&rsquo;s just so much to it, and </span><span class="c0 c1">he</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;thinks he&rsquo;s not handling it well! god fucking damn it, todoroki, it&rsquo;s the thought that counts. and she starts kind of blubbering, and she&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;i love you so much, you know that, right?&rdquo; and maybe the reason he was the only one to go up to her, to notice that she&rsquo;s struggling, is bc they&rsquo;ve begun dating recently. maybe they&rsquo;re adults, and she&rsquo;s just moved into her own apartment to try and be independent no more rich-girl, and he&rsquo;s the first one to stop by with the strawberry shortcake. - COMPLETE</span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">BnHA. kamijirou. actor AU. as an actress, jirou always held back with her designated love interests. she found it hard to take herself seriously, pretending to like someone when in reality she felt nothing. then she gets cast in the lead role </span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">BnHA. kamijirou. momo forbids jirou from saying the words, &ldquo;i&rsquo;m gonna kill myself&rdquo; even as a joke, and so the first new coping mechanism for existing jirou latches onto?

aka the zen&rsquo;in clan, so we have like megumi and maki arguing at the top of some grand staircase in front of the foyer, and so like itadori and nobara lose their tiny little minds bc what the FUCK is going on. megumi and maki look at each other, then at the humans down there, then start bickering again in this sort of older/younger sibling dynamic until idk mai comes in. i want tsumiki to come into this fic at some point too but idk when. also since she&rsquo;s not really a zen&rsquo;in, she wouldn&rsquo;t be a vampire. she might be a regular human? a fairy?? idk. anyway, nobara and itadori run away, excitedly running for their lives and they arrive back in town all exhilarated like &ldquo;that was bonkers fucking yonkers&rdquo; and they high five and sneak back into their places. i straight-up don&rsquo;t know what era this is gonna be but it&rsquo;s honestly whatever. anyway, uhh stuff happens i guess and they end up back in the castle for reasons. idk maybe the townspeople think they&rsquo;re tainted or something now. maybe they agree that vampires hot, maybe they&rsquo;re just curious abt the fucking eldritch horror they saw hanging out in the castle yard (aka gojou-sensei). and um idk what the plot&rsquo;s gonna be. but it sounds like fun. anyway maki becomes kind of interested in nobara in particular bc holy shit those are some sharp teeth. through a series of hijinks, they probably realize everyone in town is some sort of supernatural creature, and that they, too, are supernatural beings. maybe it gets awakened on their twentieth birthday or something idk or maybe it depends on the clan i really don&rsquo;t know. anyway this is my way of making nobara into a mermaid and yuuji into a demon for the au. </span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">JJK. </span><span class="c0 c1">a man without eyes [[saw plums on a tree(?)]]. </span><span class="c8 c0">probably no ships?

can you choose to not regret something? are you lying to yourself at that point? is that bad faith? the title comes from the fact that i once saw the riddle, &ldquo;&ldquo;in order for you to move forward, i must be left behind. what am i?&rdquo; and my immediate thought was &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s a regret.&rdquo; but the real answer was apparently, &ldquo;a salamander, which leaves its tail behind when in danger.&rdquo; which i think is STUPID, personally, on a superficial level, but does a salamander ever regret losing its tail? it was for the sake of survival. can you regret being born? again, this depends on how you define regret. and anyway, the salamander can often grow back its tail. in giving up its tail, it also gains another chance to do things right (i.e. not run into danger and get killed). why would you regret that? because it&rsquo;s painful? is it better to be alive and in pain, or dead and feel nothing ever again? i think that to commit to being a jujutsu sorcerer, you have to commit to dying. because the kids are so young, it&rsquo;s very much in that &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; stage of life, so they don&rsquo;t fully understand what they&rsquo;re committing to. can they truly commit to something they don&rsquo;t understand? maybe that&rsquo;s why they have regrets. and i think that jujukai agrees with me to an extent that a regret is more a wish than a feeling. &ldquo;no sorcerer dies without regrets.&rdquo; and the examples are all kind of like &ldquo;i wish i&rsquo;d done this; i wish someone had told me that&rdquo; kind of thing. all of these specific wishes. those are regrets. surprisingly, i think megumi is the one member of the plant trio most likely to not regret dying at any moment, at least not regret the death itself. yuuji comes close after, since i don&rsquo;t think they really value their lives enough to regret dying. nobara would regret dying though, i think. yuuji would feel most strongly about his regrets when staring death in the face; megumi would probably feel mutely resigned, since yeah he has them but i think he also accepts them. yuuji i don&rsquo;t think would want to accept his regrets. </span></li><li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">JJK. </span><span class="c0 c1">i found a heart and made it all my own.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pairings don&rsquo;t matter. maybe nobamaki since i need to write them more. soulmate AU. or is it? exploration of the tension between &ldquo;soulmates are real, and there is someone out there who will naturally love you the way you need to be loved, and whom you will naturally love in all the ways they need to be loved, simply because that&rsquo;s what it means to be soulmates&rdquo; and &ldquo;soulmates are made, not found.&rdquo; maki thinks soulmates are stupid; she wants to love someone on purpose, not because something as stupid and unproveable as </span><span class="c0 c1">fate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;said she would. she values her autonomy in that sense, and she values hard work put into anything, most of all a relationship. she&rsquo;s camp &ldquo;soulmates are made, not found.&rdquo; nobara is a gone, gone, </span><span class="c0 c1">gone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;romantic, obsessed with the idea of soulmates being destined to love one another, and she yearns to find her own someday. &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll know them when i see them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;or when i meet them and talk to them. but probably i&rsquo;ll just see them and know.&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s like, a series of off days for the students, and the guys go to hang out, and nobara takes maki off shopping and stuff, and each segment covers a different part of the hangout formula&mdash; deciding to go out, the train ride out there, checking out the shops together, lunch, exploring the local areas, and the train ride home&mdash; as they argue on different points of their soulmate philosophies&mdash; what happens if you simply never meet your other half, what happens if you meet someone you&rsquo;re more intuitively compatible with than your current &lsquo;soulmate&rsquo; partner, what happens if you know the other person&rsquo;s your soulmate but you don&rsquo;t feel that spark, what happens if you get tired of putting in that work, what happens if you meet your soulmate when in love with someone else, what if both are true at once? (or, how will you ever know for sure that this person </span><span class="c0 c1">is</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;your soulmate if they&rsquo;re made not found? how do you know if you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;made it&rdquo;?) thus arriving at my current preferred portrayal of soulmates, where yes, there&rsquo;s someone out there, but free will exists and makes fate a fluid thing. fate is more like&hellip; a probability wave, of this projection of this most likely outcome based off the current state of the variables and your history of decision making. but because free will is still a thing, you can still do things that are ooc, changing the projections of fate, and your destined person can change if you change enough, too. like, can you imagine being soulmates with someone, but then free will is also a thing and when you guys actually meet, maybe your souls were made for each other at the start but your personalities sure don&rsquo;t align. and anyway, it would be like six different outings all spliced together, so their conversations all happen on different days (since it takes time for people to warm up to other ideas), and by the end of it, they ARE in love. and as they come to more and more of an agreement on what soulmates are, i think it would be neat for soulmarks to start appearing on both of them&mdash; a rose on maki&rsquo;s wrist, one of maki&rsquo;s cool spear things between nobara&rsquo;s shoulder blades&mdash; that grows stronger as they bond. a reflection of both soulmates being real, and that they&rsquo;re made and take some level of effort to grow. </span></li><li class="c29 c37 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">GI. xiaoven, chilumi. red string of fate AU. in a &ldquo;soulmates but make it take work&rdquo;

and xiao is like &ldquo;ew&rdquo; and is totally allergic to the idea of the red string of fate and goes off to beat up some enemies or w/e to forget about it, and after a while it just blends into his life, and he doesn&rsquo;t think abt it. he doesn&rsquo;t seek out the other person; he has his DUTIES to carry out. venti is more like, &ldquo;ehhhh?&rdquo; n gets curious about it, which brings up the question of fate vs. free will. and ultimately, i rather want the conclusion to be, &ldquo;some things are simply fated to be entwined. what that means is free for you to interpret as you will. whether that means you will fall in love, become mortal enemies, best friends, or simply save each other&rsquo;s lives, no one knows, but you are tied together. freedom can have its limits and its boundaries. we are all bound by the laws of physics, after all. it&rsquo;s all how you see the world: as your cage, or as your oyster.&rdquo; to make them falling in love into more of a choice than an inevitability. anyway, venti brushes it off for a while, goes back to drinking, but eventually, his curiosity leads him to follow it all the way over to xiao, whom he watches almost succumb, and he plays the flute for xiao, saving him. xiao passes out or smth, safe for the time being, and venti watches over him out of curiosity until he wakes up. xiao scowls and kicks him out (bc he&rsquo;s AFRAIIIID OF FORMING HUMAN ATTACHMENTS &gt;:3c), while venti&rsquo;s kind of like &ldquo;only a matter of time ,&rsquo;:3c&rdquo; and we probably cut to another conversation btwn venti n zhongli abt how fate doesn&rsquo;t always like to interfere with the workings of the world, but sometimes it makes decisions and ties people together, which leads into the &ldquo;not necessarily falling in love&rdquo; bit. uhhh stuff happens, and pining. xiao pines a lot. he&rsquo;s a big pining baby tbh. venti is more willing to indulge himself in visiting xiao, and as time passes, he helps xiao realize the Meaning of Freedom&trade; and how the people of liyue don&rsquo;t rlly need him watching over them so vigilantly anymore. he can let go. and so xiao allows himself to fall, and it&rsquo;s hard bc at this point his job has become like his security blanket, even if it&rsquo;s also killing him, bc it&rsquo;s familiar and that makes it comfortable and bearable, but venti is there to catch him. and he is there for venti when he needs someone stable and there for him in his grief. for as the god of freedom, no one has ever thought that he might want something steady tying him down. and for them, to interpret their fated connection as one of a romance, that deep-hearted romance abt the connection of two people who cannot connect with anyone else in the exact same way that they so desperately need from one another specifically, is what lets them be happy. </span></li></ol><ol class="c5 lst-kix_d7w0c1ypmcra-1 start" start="1"><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">full notes on this doc here (</span><span class="c7 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1RMl721O4r0V2ETDw7fFOxtuLWN1BWK1WZb3svqpVk/edit%23&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715494425783032&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QZccmzGzIS2WoB9AdUY6u">IT&#39;S NOT JUST A RED STRING OF FATE AU MOM IT&#39;S SO MUCH MOOOOORE</a></span><span class="c8 c0">)</span></li></ol><ol class="c5 lst-kix_d7w0c1ypmcra-2 start" start="1"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">the archons can see some of the particularly thicker threads bc everyone has threads connecting with everyone, but with regular friends like lumine n amber or w/e, it&rsquo;s so thin it may as well not be there, and so the archons can only really see the important ones, which is why most people only really have one thread. only the god of fate can see every single thread</span></li></ol><ol class="c5 lst-kix_d7w0c1ypmcra-1" start="2"><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">venti being friends with god of time means that venti Knows everything abt this is just a matter of time. fate is pretty intertwined w/time, bc &ldquo;face your fate&rdquo;

and paimon goes to hang out w/amber personally, and venti&rsquo;s just like &ldquo;lemme join&rdquo; and lumine is like &ldquo;i am a millionaire, venti. you would not believe how many mora i got killing hilichurls n leyline disorders&rdquo;

over and over again, and zhongli has to constantly be like &ldquo;no. no. no. no. i trust him not to do this again&rdquo; childe twitches n xiao is like &ldquo;now my lord? now my lord? now my lord?&rdquo; with just the look in his eye. </span></li><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">childe would try to buy xiao over to make the whole &ldquo;can i kill him milord&rdquo; thing go away, but xiao shoots that down immediately. anyway, then childe learns from zhongli how to win xiao over w/offerings, and then xiao would be like &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; abt him n not try to kill him anymore, while childe is like &ldquo;we&rsquo;re comrades now&rdquo; &ldquo;we are not comrades&rdquo; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re both separated from our friends right&rdquo; n xiao is like &ldquo;just bc we&rsquo;re in similar situations does not mean we are comrades.&rdquo; but childe takes that a win anyway bc &ldquo;he admits we&rsquo;re in similar situations hell yeah&rdquo;

why are they putting so much effort into it?&rdquo; and the answer is obvs bc venti is double majoring in music and theatre i don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re expecting out of him. xiao is an angsty, angsty math major, who feels an INCREDIBLE NEED to convince everyone that this is a Real, Legitimate Marriage&trade; for a couple reasons probably all involving zhongli. one, he is for whatever reason convinced that zhongli thinks it&rsquo;s real. like, maybe he forgot to tell zhongli it&rsquo;s for tuition purposes (bc &ldquo;tax evasion&rdquo; is what venti tells xiao, and then together they tell everyone it&rsquo;s for &ldquo;tuition purposes&rdquo; bc that&rsquo;s what everyone keeps assuming, and it&rsquo;s awkward to xiao to explain that he&rsquo;s marrying venti for TAX EVASION), and he doesn&rsquo;t realize that zhongli has probably figured out that it&rsquo;s all a sham (like srsly c&rsquo;mon you weren&rsquo;t even dating you were just BROS (in huge scare quotes there) and now you&rsquo;re getting MARRIED like that&rsquo;s just not what real people who have no romantic investment in each other do, xiao. two, he&rsquo;s scared the school will take his scholarship away if they find out he&rsquo;s exploiting the marriage tuition loophole with venti, and that&rsquo;s also bad for venti bc he&rsquo;s the one who supposedly needs these discounts so badly. and three, zhongli WILL hurt venti if he touches EVEN A HAIR on xiao&rsquo;s head, and xiao knows this, and he wants venti to be safe and happy, so this ties into &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t realize zhongli knows it&rsquo;s fake but not fake.&rdquo; anyway, they navigate their relationships with other people. xiao doesn&rsquo;t really have a lot of friends, so venti pulls him along on outings w/his own various friends. he becomes friends with his mcdonald&rsquo;s coworker chongyun, who ends up learning the most truth about the situation from xiao&rsquo;s pov, probably against his will. venti keeps lying as easily as he fucking breathes, but xiao is a bad liar, and when he lies, they weigh on him, which is why he ends up dumping stuff on chongyun (the high schooler?). venti eventually tells zhongli the truth, and zhongli is like &ldquo;fuckin thought so&rdquo; n refuses to advise any further, and so then xv end up confronting their relationship and what they wanna be, and it&rsquo;s a struggle for xiao to accept bc he&rsquo;s LIKE THAT&trade; but they get over themselves. like xiao doesn&rsquo;t even REALIZE he&rsquo;s in love with venti for most of the fic. he just tells himself he&rsquo;s doing it bc &ldquo;venti really needs me, and i want to do good for people to make up for the fact that i am me, and i am a bad person&rdquo; bc he&rsquo;s SO ANGSTY AND DRAMATIC I SWEAR TO GOD. (venti teaches him to do makeup at some point, and he NEVER STOPS afterwards he becomes SO PRETTY) and anyway, after venti&rsquo;s confession xiao can&rsquo;t stand being in the same room as him so they get like a fake divorce and everything (that&rsquo;s not legally binding bc tax reasons must still be done. it&rsquo;s like holding hands when they&rsquo;re mad at each other bc not doing so makes them sadder), and xiao has a crisis to zhongli (who is so so tired. being zhongli is SUFFERING in this au), has his &ldquo;OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&rdquo; moment, n then LOCKS HIMSELF IN HIS DORM ROOM FOR TWO WEEKS, REFUSING TO BE PERCEIVED BC HE IS LITERALLY THAT EMBARRASSED.

might be venti tbh) bc they sent back a whole-ass essay full of thought-provoking points in response to his two second joke question, and aether decides, &ldquo;what the hell, why not&rdquo; and they basically just start exchanging long, thoughtful, and emotional text letters, never even knowing each other&rsquo;s names for quite a long while until eventually, aether gets curious enough to ask. but anyway they,, obviously get to know each other intimately through this exchange of digital letters (they might honestly switch to emails at some point, since that seems like it&rsquo;d be easier for albedo) and they obviously,, also inevitably fall in love. and so one day aether gets sick of merely yearning and venti&rsquo;s just like &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you just go visit him lol&rdquo; n aether&rsquo;s like &ldquo;GENIUS&rdquo; and so aether broaches the topic to albedo who&rsquo;s just like. chill abt it. he&rsquo;s like a city or two over anyway; aether just has to take the train over. and there&rsquo;s like a couple rapid fire texting sequences btwn aether n lumine (n venti possibly) as he gets nervous abt meeting albedo for the first time. they&rsquo;ve also agreed to send images of each other at this point, which thinking abt it, was probably the moment aether fell in love w/albedo, and while aether sent an informal selfie probably (of which he probably takes like a zillion bc he&rsquo;s like that), albedo either sent a formal portrait (like college or lab id), a sketch he made himself, or a polaroid taken by none other than klee. and while i doubt this fic would ever really cover albedo&rsquo;s point of view, i think seeing aether for the first time like that, in a selfie where he&rsquo;s smiling like the sun and presenting himself how he wants the world to see him, charms him in some way. it might not be </span><span class="c0 c1">the</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;moment he falls irrevocably in love&mdash; that&rsquo;s probably a long ways off after the end of the fic&mdash; but it speaks to a subtle shift in how he views aether from someone who sparks his intellectual curiosity and finds interesting and pleasant to be around to someone whose company he&rsquo;d actively seek out. anyway, epistolary, so it ends with aether texting albedo as he leaves the train, asking him where to look, and it ends with just &ldquo;found you.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">hope as stitching on fabric. </span><span class="c0">xingyun. from &#24076;&#26395;&#30340;&#24076; etymology coming from that of embroidery, stitching on fabric. xingqiu tries to define hope for himself and why embroidery might have come to mean hope. perhaps have the story sort of follow how he&rsquo;s been reluctantly pulled into his family&rsquo;s silk company and he&rsquo;s left wondering why he feels so jealous of chongyun&rsquo;s freedom to go adventuring. like, he still sneaks out to do his vigilante stuff, just he&rsquo;s being dragged into business stuff more often now too. and they&rsquo;re getting older, too, and his parents are starting to talk about ~marriage~ and stuff, and it&rsquo;s not that xingqiu is particularly </span><span class="c0 c1">opposed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the concept of getting married&mdash; if he had to say, he&rsquo;s either ambivalent or has just kind of always assumed it&rsquo;d happen some nebulous day in the future (that never comes to be the present)&mdash; but something about it just rubs him the wrong way. it bothers him even more when he&rsquo;s bitching abt it to chongyun while at wanmin restaurant, and chongyun mentions his parents have been trying to drag him into similar discussions, but xingqiu can&rsquo;t quite pinpoint </span><span class="c0 c1">why</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;these things bug him so much. xiangling isn&rsquo;t getting bothered by these talks by her dad (she has a girlfriend maybe? or her dad just doesn&rsquo;t see the point in bothering her abt it yet), and neither is yanfei, or hu tao. maybe xinyan, since she grew up poor and her parents wanted her to grow into a phoenix according to her character story, but xinyan is used to resisting those kinds of pressures, so when xq bitches to her abt it, she&rsquo;s like &ldquo;haha tell me about it. don&rsquo;t let it get you down though, dude!&rdquo; and sure, maybe yunjin is getting bothered by her parents to the same extent as xingqiu (which could get jossed when she gets released lol), but really it doesn&rsquo;t affect xingqiu the way it does when the person being pressured to marry (n settle down?) is chongyun, and chongyun isn&rsquo;t even BOTHERED by these talks nearly as much as rich boy xingqiu, </span><span class="c0 c1">SO WHY IS IT BOTHERING HIM SO MUCH??? </span><span class="c0">and that&rsquo;s what makes xingqiu realize he&rsquo;s in love w/chongyun (and has been for he doesn&rsquo;t even know how long because no matter how hard he tries, he just can&rsquo;t pinpoint the exact moment his feelings shifted from best friends to a crush). he&rsquo;s jealous not of chongyun for his freedom, but of everything that shares its time n simple existence w/chongyun during his adventures. and that is such a disgustingly selfish revelation to xq, and i want it to happen as he&rsquo;s like, fixing his jacket bc he got into a wild adventure w/his friends that resulted in him needing to mend it. that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hope like stitching on fabric.&rdquo; you stitch the fabric because you </span><span class="c0 c1">want</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it to be better in some way because you</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;care</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about it. hope is borne from desire. and he wants to spend his life w/chongyun. and here, xingqiu finishes his stitching, ties the thread off w/a little knot, and cuts the thread on his teeth like a heathen. or maybe w/a pair of tiny little scissors bc he&rsquo;s a fancy little rich boy after all. and he purses his lips, holds his jacket on his lap, as he stares off at the moon through the window, with its light streaming through onto his bed. and he just lets that realization sink in. he wants to spend his life w/chongyun. he could do this for the rest of his life, and while he knows it&rsquo;ll be rough at times, it would satisfy him. (and he thinks to himself, &ldquo;wait. if i&rsquo;m in love w/chongyun, does that mean i wanna&hellip;&rdquo; n he thinks abt kissing chongyun, which is a horrible decision really bc as soon as he realizes he wants to, he can&rsquo;t really un-realize it when he&rsquo;s spending time w/chongyun, can he now.) and so begins xingqiu&rsquo;s agony of existence. bc now that he can recognize the desires underneath his jealousy, he knows what he hopes for now (chongyun as his boyfriend/life partner/whatever really), and like. he can&rsquo;t just </span><span class="c0 c1">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pursue his hopes and dreams, right? what kind of fucking protagonist doesn&rsquo;t follow their dreams? but also, he&rsquo;s kind of a self-important writer bitch, so he&rsquo;s gotta be Subtle abt conveying his changed feelings to chongyun, but the problem w/that is that chongyun just doesn&rsquo;t fuckin get it lol. realizing this, xq goes to his friends, and they plan a grand exploit which definitely sounds like it&rsquo;s gonna go down in the books as an epic adventure, but obviously goes awry in some wild way, putting them in actual mortal peril, and at the end of it all, xingqiu just spits it out. but as they plan, xq allows himself to really </span><span class="c0 c1">feel</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;all this hope, like it&rsquo;s all coming together. mm i feel like i&rsquo;ve lost the point of this fic. </span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">fellas is it gay if it&rsquo;s in a gay bar but you&rsquo;re only the security guard?</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;xiaoven. gay bar AU. - COMPLETE</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">written in stone</span><span class="c0">(?), or more likely </span><span class="c0 c1">blank slate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0 c1">clean slate</span><span class="c8 c0">. ganqing. college/modern AU. magical realism tossed in for kicks?

i got xx grade, which i have to say is in no small part thanks to you giving me a nuanced look into how the opposition thinks, so. thank you for that.&rdquo; right next to a doodle of ganyu&rsquo;s constellation that ganyu had done earlier that day bc she had a bit of downtime. and ganyu comes in the next day and sees the note, and she borrows the chalk, and she&rsquo;s like &ldquo;i also got xx grade, thanks to the way you challenged my arguments. i found your opinion that we have been overemphasizing rex lapis&rsquo;s contributions to liyue and the greater teyvatan history to be very thought provoking, even if i ultimately completely disagree, but i never did get to hear your thoughts on how humanity could have been expected to do those things w/o the help of archons&rdquo; or w/e bc i guess this is like. lowkey magical realism now or smth, though rather than having ganyu thousands of years old, she can still be half qilin but college age/same age as keqing and have been raised in a traditional household sort of thing. benign magic sort of thing. maybe ganyu IS STILL thousands of years old in this and is attending college to get an idea of what life is like for young people these days. i don&rsquo;t know. the point is that ganyu compliments keqing&rsquo;s perspective, even if she doesn&rsquo;t agree w/how keqing thinks things would have worked out, which sparks further conversation on the chalk wall revealing that they actually have very similar life goals and long-term desires. they settle into this sort of routine where they talk on the chalk wall through the week, and then it gets erased over the weekend, and they start anew on mondays, and they get to know each other through the chalk wall and sort of fall in love w/the way the other portrays themself through words (their innermost selves or w/e). meanwhile, in the lab or discussion they share together or smth, they&rsquo;re pretty frequently butting heads. i feel like keqing might almost start a fistfight, but the ta talks them down from it, and it&rsquo;s not like, an overwhelmingly unpleasant experience, but they&rsquo;re definitely wary of each other and have kind of low opinions of each other&rsquo;s personalities lol. anyway, one day towards the end of the semester, keqing gets tired of all this through-the-wall middleman nonsense and suggests they meet up where they usually exchange letters one of these days, and ganyu agrees, and they each dress up a little (but not too much) to make a good first impression and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;YOU??&rdquo; and like the fic would basically be abt how gq think they have rlly clashing personalities (their irl conflict) but are actually way more similar n compatible than they expected (their letters showing their inner selves and also talking to each other in more good faith than they typically did in class) and coming to care for each other like that. they probs also fall in love w/each other at least a little in their irl meetings too, but they&rsquo;re in denial abt that. but truly the inherent romanticism of being academic rivals lmao.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">best friends (or lovers!). </span><span class="c8 c0">xingyun, but in like a qpp kind of way. an exploration of what it means to be the most important person in someone&rsquo;s life and what it means to build your life with someone. how do you define a relationship w/someone when it&rsquo;s kind of ship-of-theseus&rsquo;d itself into smth else?

that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re doing, but it&rsquo;s hard not to feel their judgemental stares. if thoma thinks back, he can remember even ayato didn&rsquo;t really consider him one of their own before he got his Vision; after all, while it </span><span class="c0 c1">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a kindness to say, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want to get involved, you should leave now&rdquo;, it carries with it this feeling of, &ldquo;this is not your problem, for you are not one of us.&rdquo; ayato&rsquo;s obvs not like that anymore, but it&rsquo;s been different from his relationship to ayaka from the start. ayaka, who was probably somewhere btwn ten and twelve when her parents died while ayato was like 14-16, didn&rsquo;t have so much bias in her when she first met thoma, and so as all three grew up, she was the one most easily accepting of him as a full member of the kamisato clan, even choosing him as her fianc&eacute;e when she came of age. and it was a shock to a lot of people (including thoma, probably), bc ~omg the princess picked not only a peasant but a foreigner too omg~. and sometimes, thoma wonders if she feels the burden of being related to him, bc he loves her, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to make life harder for her. but she insists that she&rsquo;s fine; the fact that he&rsquo;s mixed and looks foreign is no more a burden for her than it is for him, she says. (which is true, because it </span><span class="c0 c1">does</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;burden both of them in reality, and this is ayaka&rsquo;s way of telling thoma she sees his struggles (even if he doesn&rsquo;t) and is willing to share in them.) and then the traveler lumine sweeps through the land, and after the vision hunt decree is abolished, she asks him one day if he would ever want to move back to mondstadt. after all, living in inazuma as a foreigner is a huge pain. it gets better once people get to know you, but getting people to give you that chance in the first place is hard, and you&rsquo;re constantly having to earn people&rsquo;s trust in order to get stuff done bc so rarely does one person&rsquo;s trust significantly affect another person&rsquo;s when just getting started. and thoma&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;nope!&rdquo; and lumine doesn&rsquo;t believe him, so he takes a bit to explain it all&mdash; how while mond was nice and it was a pleasant place to spend his childhood, inazuma is where he has built his life, made his </span><span class="c0 c1">home</span><span class="c0">.

not sure where that would go but i&rsquo;m obsessed w/it. anyway, meanwhile, venti is dreaming, bc he&rsquo;s entered one of his Long Slumbers, and i guess being sealed away means that xiao occupies the same space as venti&rsquo;s dream realm for whatever reason. i don&rsquo;t know. does this need to be explained, or can we just suspend our disbelief for this? thank you. xiao knows he&rsquo;s in a dream, but venti is probably unaware at first, like not until he starts noticing things shifting (as they do in dreams) or xiao just straight-up tells him. this is also kind of dumb as hell, but at the same time i&rsquo;m obsessed with the idea that xv just share this dream space which just so happens to look like a castle by the sea (which has a LIGHTHOUSE TOWER, which perhaps either venti or neither of them are allowed to enter?? &gt;:3c), which also contains like a magic mirror that would allow them to see what is happening in the real world. ANYWAY, obviously they are both stuck in this dream world castle thing together&hellip; mebbe&hellip; although ACTUALLY, what if zhongli simply put xiao to sleep as the whole Sealing Away thing to hunt down like nightmares or some shit (bc xiao would have otherwise insisted on being,,, as they say euphemistically,,, </span><span class="c0 c1">put to sleep</span><span class="c0">, although it would be ~fun~ to keep his dead or alive status ambiguous for most of the fic &gt;:3c), and the abandoned castle in the woods venti can&rsquo;t leave is actually his </span><span class="c0 c1">nightmare</span><span class="c0">. but xiao doesn&rsquo;t realize this for like idk various reasons i guess, which is why venti&rsquo;s dream (nightmare) becomes kind of his base. he probably takes on a more monstrous appearance when hunting down nightmares, like y&rsquo;know yaksha mask and stuff, but does he take it off when he returns to the castle by the sea where venti is? probably not at first, since he is first committed to his duty, and he probably doesn&rsquo;t want to really see the things he&rsquo;s doing (relying instead on his other senses + vision) (but also: </span><span class="c0 c1">he is too ashamed to be seen </span><span class="c0">[as human?]) bc even though nightmares feel and taste foul upon his tongue, the actions themselves remind him of his time under the evil god, and wearing a mask and pretending (believing) he&rsquo;s a monster makes it easier on him. meanwhile, can venti even leave the castle by the sea? the castle, perhaps, but definitely not its grounds&mdash; that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s his nightmare; as idyllic as the castle by the sea might appear, it became a cage the instant he was unable to leave. it should also remain hidden to the reader that where they are is a dream at all until near the end when they KISS and like i guess xiao eats the bitter parts of venti&rsquo;s nightmare, transforming it into something light that he can wake up from. anyway, so bc of that, the castle lighthouse by the sea has day/night cycles that happen at random bc they are in a dream, and xiao comes and goes as he pleases to be the conquerer of demons/nightmares and all that stuff. venti stays in the castle and like, composes music, plays for the little woodland creatures from um. the woods right behind the beach or something. anyway, xiao probably doesn&rsquo;t know who venti is, like, he probably thinks there&rsquo;s just This Guy here for WHATEVER reason like maybe he doesn&rsquo;t even realize he&rsquo;s sharing a place w/venti until some time in. the dihua flute thing hasn&rsquo;t happened in canon at the point where this fic starts, THOUGH HONESTLY&hellip; IT WOULD SLAP REALLY HARD IF </span><span class="c0 c1">XIAO WERE TO REALIZE THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CASTLE BY THE SEA WHEN HE JUST DRAGS HIMSELF BACK TO THE SHORE AND COLLAPSES AT SUNSET/MOONRISE ABT TO DIE BUT THEN IS BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK THROUGH&mdash; YOU GUESSED IT&mdash; </span><span class="c24 c1">THE SOUND OF A FLUTE PLAYING IN THE DISTANCE</span><span class="c0">. in this case, from the castle by the sea he&rsquo;s been inhabiting (perhaps the lighthouse itself? will have to think abt the symbolism of that tho). and since this is The Dihua Flute Moment, this is pretty much the moment where xiao and venti first Meet each other bc all other times before were like, brief meetings in group settings. so here they meet each other as individuals. xiao obvs doesn&rsquo;t know that venti is the anemo archon; venti, knowing stories of the yaksha and liyue culture in general from being friends w/zhongli, sees xiao&rsquo;s anemo vision and also chooses to keep this information to himself, lest xiao start treating him with more reverence than he deserves. so anyway, they start this kind of cohabitation thing going around. xiao comes home to the castle by the sea, and venti, lonely little venti, tries to get to know him, tries to get past his prickly exterior. it takes a while, but eventually, xiao starts tolerating him more and more, though he never removes his mask. it&rsquo;s almost like a phantom of the opera kind of thing; the mask just stays ON. except venti respects xiao&rsquo;s boundaries like that, and it&rsquo;s through time as they get to know each other, as venti starts being vulnerable w/xiao, the mask starts to fade around the edges. like y&rsquo;know how the mask just teleports onto his face n stuff yeah yeah yeah that but slowly. xiao doesn&rsquo;t notice it at first, esp since it just goes fully on when he leaves to do his nightmare eating stuff, but at some point, he starts feeling safe enough w/venti to let half his mask slip, and he actually </span><span class="c0 c1">sees venti clearly enough </span><span class="c0">that the rest of it fades away bc he&rsquo;s just so surprised he forgets to maintain his walls. and like&hellip; they </span><span class="c0 c1">see</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;each other for the first time, and for a moment it&rsquo;s just surprise, written all over both of their faces, and then xiao just excuses himself to run off and eat nightmares again bc oh god oh wow those were a lot of feelings he was having just now what the hell is happening in his chest that felt </span><span class="c0 c1">nice</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;actually and he doesn&rsquo;t deserve this; this is his punishment and he&rsquo;s a sinner and so he should go atone for his sins and suffer etc etc. and he&rsquo;s away for longer than usual, and venti finds himself missing xiao&rsquo;s quiet company. but anyway, xiao returns in the dead of like&hellip; &ldquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;night&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;, slips past wherever venti has fallen asleep to have time to himself in the </span><span class="c0 c1">lighthouse</span><span class="c0">, actually, bc both a shelter and a warning. there, the mask comes off again, and this becomes normal when he&rsquo;s alone, though it remains on in various shades when he comes out and sees venti again bc ofc he comes out and sees venti again. he finds himself missing venti&rsquo;s peppy company, after all. there&rsquo;s this connection that&rsquo;s formed btwn them that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed at the time but now tugs at him, draws him to venti like a moth to a flame. (he&rsquo;s falling in love, but still slowly at this stage hehehehe). anyway, venti starts successfully convincing xiao to be more chill, since while yes, vanquishing nightmares is his duty, he can&rsquo;t properly carry it out if he&rsquo;s just gonna keep destroying himself like this. come here and hang out in the garden w/me, dummy. and yet slowly, xiao starts to piece together venti&rsquo;s character, and now that they&rsquo;re spending more time together, he realizes that venti can&rsquo;t actually leave the castle grounds. he&rsquo;s trapped there. and slowly, this idyllic little castle by the sea gets realized as a nightmare, and bc venti has been opening up abt stuff, xiao has pieced together that this is the god of freedom&rsquo;s nightmare, that venti </span><span class="c0 c1">is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the god of freedom. and like. blah blah blah learning to accept that you are seen and loved all the same, the inherent tenderness of constancy and acceptance has happened btwn them all this time, so they&rsquo;ve fallen in love and venti is just waiting for xiao to make the first move. and so&mdash; and this is critical&mdash; </span><span class="c0 c1">the only way either of them can leave the dream realm and wake up in teyvat again is to kiss so that xiao can take the weight out of venti&rsquo;s now-bittersweet dream.</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;i know this is a written medium so this can&rsquo;t be shown, but KNOW that i am picturing the home they made together in the lighthouse castle by the sea blurring and swirling and fading away as they like kiss (i am feeling Extremely Perceived rn and i don&rsquo;t like that lol). and then they part, and xiao feels venti&rsquo;s hand slipping away as his fading voice says goodbye and thank you for the sweet dreams, and xiao is helpless to see him go or however you word that sort of thing. it looks/feels like that one idle w/the anemo pixie thing, and he is alone in his own empty dreamscape for a while, for he hasn&rsquo;t had any desires in so long that he&rsquo;s rather forgotten how to dream. and then, he is pulled out of his slumber back into the waking world, where he is greeted by definitely zhongli, though i&rsquo;m not sure abt the other adepti. i have no idea if the other yaksha are still alive at this point who knows. anyway, xiao returns to the waking world, to his regular duties of destroying the remnants of old gods, and slowly (as he YEARNS), he develops that canon dream of being able to dance in a field to the sound of venti&rsquo;s flute once more. he doesn&rsquo;t see venti again for a few years (though that means very little to either of them as immortals), when they finally meet again when venti comes to liyue to visit zhongli, and the fic ends when their eyes meet (bc they meet face to face!! and xiao is not wearing his mask!!!! and he&rsquo;s not running away!!!!!!) and venti smiles at him. </span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">GI. ganqing. cowherd and weaver girl AU, kind of. setting is more of an ancient china/liyue vibe. keqing has never really thought much of the adepti, immortals, and divinity in general until one night, when she heads out to bathe, she sees a qilin seemingly spun from frost descend from the heavens and transform into the most beautiful girl she&rsquo;s seen in her life. their eyes meet and keqing&rsquo;s breath catches, qilin girl gracefully and delicately approaches blah blah blah. kq stands her ground (weird around obvious divinity) and ganyu introduces herself. she&rsquo;s an immortal, mostly, who spends her days spinning the threads of fate for the actual god of fate to weave into lives and destinies, and perhaps kq scoffs at the idea, for surely immortals have better things to do w/their time than sit and spin all day. smth smth ganyu comes to appreciate the wonders of humanity (their creativity, resilience, etc) and keqing comes to appreciate the work of the divine. they fall in love, get married, and live happily for a few years before celestia takes notice of ganyu&rsquo;s absence, since a day in celestia is a year in teyvat sort of thing, and command her to return. ganyu tells keqing the news, and keqing gets protective of her love and vows to find her in celestia even if it takes her whole life. in order to do that she needs a Vision, which kq thinks is DUMB bc why must humans prove themselves capable before the gods will listen to them, their own subjects? in the end, if anything it really is a showcase of the power of humanity&mdash; she&rsquo;s done smth w/her own strength so incredibly powerful it was impossible to ignore, basically FORCING the gods to notice a mere mortal. she still scorns the concept but must buy into the system in order to get her wife back. so keqing earns her vision (which is delivered by ganyu for a brief moment where they may reunite) and kq fights her way up to celestia to demand the gods either stop lording themselves over humanity, or do something FOR ONCE abt all the people praying in vain every day for their guidance and mercy on their lives. and also let her wife live as she chooses dammit. blah blah blah stuff goes awry, kq gets kicked out of celestia, but ganyu grabs her hand as she falls, and the two tumble down to earth as shooting stars. in their landing, they lose their Visions and ganyu is made mortal, but at least they are reunited and know they have the power w/in themselves to change the world whenever they&rsquo;re ready to take it on again. and they both live happily ever after.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">smoke gets in your eyes</span><span class="c0">, or </span><span class="c0 c1">highway to hell</span><span class="c0">. it really depends on whether it&rsquo;s a dramatique and angsty tone, or a morbid romcom. modified canon setting where everyone with a vision has something unique given to them, in this sort of &ldquo;with great power comes great responsibility&rdquo; kind of way. BESTIES HUXIAO with side/minor yantao, xiaoven, and ganqing. canonverse/canon divergence. so ever since hu tao got her Vision, she&rsquo;s been able to see a timer that counts down to people&rsquo;s death day. but the one day, her beloved yanfei dies (and her body vanishes?) way way earlier than she&rsquo;s supposed to, so she journeys into the afterlife in search of her and find out what malicious things might be happening underneath the surface. along the way, the other adepti get involved. keqing vanishes much like yanfei, which draws ganyu&rsquo;s attention. xiao gets involved bc adepti business (visiting zhongli when ganyu n hu tao are talking abt this stuff?), and hu tao makes him let her see his death timer (bc out of respect, she doesn&rsquo;t check mortals&rsquo; timers w/o their permission, and the adepti are able to hide theirs from her regardless), at which point she realizes he was supposed to die </span><span class="c0 c1">centuries</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;ago (bc haha dihua flute incident :^)) and she&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;all right. something&rsquo;s going on where someone&rsquo;s targeting the adepti, probably because SOMEONE is not dead when they are OVERDUE.&rdquo; which also kind of implies that qiqi should get involved, so who knows, maybe it&rsquo;s not that xiao was supposed to die centuries ago but qiqi stuff instead and they target the adepti anyway bc they were the ones who killed her in the first place? either way, the powers that be decided to prey on the youngest (and so therefore presumably the weakes) of the adepti: yanfei. now, xiao isn&rsquo;t close at ALL w/yanfei, but once they realize he&rsquo;s tied up in all this, he gets involved in the rescue and puts in his all. (and i mean, if this is gonna be post-2.7 chasm quest, then maybe he&rsquo;s familiar with yanfei and appreciates her as like his little cousin or smth, but wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of her first if he was gonna try to kidnap someone close to him for ransom.) anyway, ganyu stays behind in the harbor to keep watch as hu tao n xiao head into the underworld to find whoever the fuck is trying to mess with the adepti. they have a LOT of close calls, but hu tao&rsquo;s experience and xiao&rsquo;s adeptal nature save them time and time again. they see horrors beyond mortal comprehension, face their greatest fears, see people who have long since died like guizhong and hu tao&rsquo;s grandpa, and also the nameless bard at some point so that xiao can have a jolt of deathly cold shock at the sight of him, which hu tao then will ask about during their fireside chats that they start having after a few days of this, where they also try to piece together what&rsquo;s going on. (blah blah blah insert xv here bc i am a measly worm.) but hu tao is hopeful by nature and xiao is already traumatized as hell, so they weather the storm together and become besties. the closer they get to the depths of hell, the more vulnerable they get in their heart-to-hearts. hu tao finds out who venti is to xiao, who also comes to accept his feelings for venti and is talked into doing smth abt it when they return by hu tao. i&rsquo;d like to think that xiao brings his flute w/him into the afterlife bc hu tao told him to bring smth that would ground him to the land of the living. they survive off of burnt offerings from ganyu and zhongli, since they can&rsquo;t eat down there but still need to live. hu tao uses her knowledge of The Rituals&trade; to set a number of their obstacles to rest. she understands The Rituals&trade; and all, but smth abt seeing them play out so literally hits different. i think this sort of journey through ungrieved souls and such would also allow hu tao to mature out of her current style of funeral director, where it shifts away from &ldquo;YEAH PARTY!! SALES!!!&rdquo; to smth more down-to-earth but still jokey, like ask a mortician caitlyn doughty. meanwhile, what&rsquo;s happened to keqing and yanfei is that they&rsquo;ve been kidnapped by the demon king of hell. they try to escape together, but realize that while yanfei has a bit of knowledge she&rsquo;s picked up from hu tao, they still don&rsquo;t have anywhere near enough knowledge of the bowels of hell to actually do that, so they&rsquo;re kind of stuck where they are lest they Die For Real. however, that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from being proactive abt their capture bc now yanfei can see the final judgements of the souls they meet, and so they start piecing together the story of the demon king of hell and what the fuck is going on. the demon king of hell is actually just remnants of an old god xiao conquered forever ago and it seeks vengeance on him bc xiao did not submit to his karmic debt. anyway epic final battle probably, and then everyone returns to the harbor safe and sound in the end and recovers from their incredible trauma the end. but yeah adding on to the modified canon thing, hu tao can see people&rsquo;s death timers, yanfei can feel the weight of a person&rsquo;s guilt upon her shoulders. i wanna say that xiao can hear the regrets of the damned n dying, but that&rsquo;s already basically canon. keqing might be able to see a little ways into the future so that she can optimize her plans, or have it such that when she plans things out in her head, she can project how they&rsquo;ll play out as she&rsquo;s modifying them, essentially seeing the butterfly effect play out. &nbsp;who knows!! i kind of want each person&rsquo;s Thing to be a thing where they learn abt other people in this potentially invasive way (so maybe w/xiao it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s regrets, not just the karmic debt, that he hears, n perhaps he struggles to control this, he prefers to stay away from people. hu tao has no regrets, so she&rsquo;s easy to talk to n actually pretty fun to be around).</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. xiaoven. insp. silver spoon, but not an au of it like originally pitched on paper lol. more like canon divergence here. xiao runs away from his perceived life failures and finds work on a farm, where he falls in love w/carefree farmhand venti, who teaches him to love himself. as they get to know each other, xiao realizes venti is also running away from problems of his own, and OH WHAT IF WHAT PROMPTED XIAO TO RUN AWAY WAS THE QIQI INCIDENT??? and so this was set before canon, and venti is running away from a mondstadt that has found out he&rsquo;s their archon and </span><span class="c0 c1">believes him</span><span class="c0">, and so he&rsquo;s trying to get out of that spotlight. and xiao doesn&rsquo;t know the simple farmhand (w/whom he is literally falling in love) is literally the anemo archon AND the flute player who saved his life </span><span class="c0 c1">quite recently actually </span><span class="c24 c1">owo</span><span class="c0">. and this stuff DOES all come to light! when ganyu finds them. see, bc the flute incident was so recent, zhongli became worried abt xiao and thus has </span><span class="c0 c1">just</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;started to order medicine to ease his karmic debt/burdens a bit more, and he tasks ganyu with delivering it to xiao, since he can&rsquo;t come into the harbor and stuff. however, ganyu can&rsquo;t find him for Quite Some Time (bc he&rsquo;s running away and can&rsquo;t return bc he thinks he&rsquo;ll die if he comes back to his duty after abandoning it), but when she </span><span class="c0 c1">does</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;eventually find him, a lot of stuff starts coming to light n just yeah hehe</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">a year without autumn.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;initially meant to be</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">xingyun, but that has been SUPER DUPER sidelined in favor of the auntie shenhe &amp; nephew chongyun dynamic lol. insp the book i read in middle school by the same name. the two of them are on the hunt for like some ghost or whatever, and they have to stop by wangshu inn. xingqiu has to stay down for a bit for whatever reason, so chongyun takes the elevator up, but the elevator is actually the thing that&rsquo;s been cursed this time around, so when he takes the elevator up, he time travels a year into the future. he makes a reservation for their room that night, then takes the elevator back down. xq is done w/his thing, and they take the stairs up bc xq wants to race or whatever, but when they get up, for some reason their reservation isn&rsquo;t there! bonkers and wacky. xq laughs it off as chongyun having his head up in the clouds again, and they don&rsquo;t worry too much about it, but then the next day, they run off down the stairs to do smth, only for chongyun to realize he left smth behind in the room, so he tells xq to scout ahead and keep any demons he meets preoccupied, and he takes the elevator up, gets his thing, </span><span class="c0 c1">and then glides down to where they&rsquo;re meant to meet up.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;except, the place they were supposed to go doesn&rsquo;t look anything like how he remembers it. there&rsquo;s this dark malaise tainting the air, and xq is nowhere in sight. mostly, he just stands there, dumbfounded for a moment, until suddenly, xiao appears. conflict conflict conflict, chongyun doesn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s gone a year into the future, xiao thinks chongyun is stupid n not worth his time so he chases him out of the area. with nothing much to do now that the adeptus has kicked him out, chongyun heads back to wangshu inn bc he figures that xq probably forgot smth too but they just didn&rsquo;t cross paths and he should just wait there. however, when he goes up the stairs to verr goldett, he doesn&rsquo;t see xq anywhere, so he just asks verr, who gives him this quizzical look. since cy didn&rsquo;t specify who the other party was when booking a room for two, cy explains that he&rsquo;s staying here rn w/xq, room whatever, but verr is still confused like, &ldquo;you booked this room yesterday morning, but it&rsquo;s remained empty since then. i figured it was just some sort of ritual or w/e since it&rsquo;s been like a year since the incident in the marsh.&rdquo; and chongyun&rsquo;s like &ldquo;huh? what incident in the marsh? where&rsquo;s xq?&rdquo; and verr purses her lips and is like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like you to forget these sorts of things.&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s when chongyun finds out that xingqiu&rsquo;s been, like, super ill or something. probably like a magical coma that doesn&rsquo;t work like real comas do but it&rsquo;s Fine. point is, he&rsquo;s been out one year w/o xq, and things have Changed&trade;. so he goes back to his room for a while, and it&rsquo;s the same room as a year in the past bc it&rsquo;s just easier to not have chongyun gaslight himself for literally no reason, and he looks through his exorcism book and can&rsquo;t seem to find anything. he sleeps on it, then returns to the harbor, where again, a lot of stuff is different. yun jin has taken a break from the yunhan opera house (bc no more xq to bring her tea leaves); feiyun&rsquo;s business has taken a dip; hu tao no longer really associates w/the liyue quartet bc it was mostly her n xq&rsquo;s street rap battles that kept her endeared to the others; xiangling is&hellip; xiangling is the closest to normal, but grief still weighs on her visibly; and xinyan is just gone, off on a voyage w/beidou. so anyway, the whole disaster that got xq knocked out and kept out was actually initiated by shenhe, probably by mistake? like cloud retainer allowed shenhe and ganyu to meet at last, and ganyu encouraged her to visit the harbor and make connections w/people, where she met her other clan members, learned where chongyun was and was encouraged to go find and mentor him, since he&rsquo;s out on an exorcism trip w/his best friend xingqiu, but while for once xq was onto smth w/the demons and stuff, shenhe was too powerful and still too indelicate w/human life and just yeah she fucked up there. chongyun runs into her (in the city?), and he doesn&rsquo;t recognize her, so he just politely and profusely apologizes until he realizes oh shit is this his aunt that his relatives have been speculating about for a while now?? at which point he starts apologizing even more, and shenhe just stares at him, face unreadable, so chongyun thinks he&rsquo;s fucked up, but before he can think to say anything, she says smth abt how he&rsquo;s acting strange; he never looks at her without scorn, never speaks to her with such kindness. and chongyun&rsquo;s just extremely confused bc to him, this is his first time meeting his aunt, and </span><span class="c0 c1">now</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;might be the moment when it dawns on someone that this might be time travel shenanigans. like, none of this situation has felt real AT ALL to chongyun, who lowkey thinks he might also be stuck in a dream by a demon or something. but like before he reaches the time travel conclusion, he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;wait you must be the demon keeping me in a dream&rdquo; or smth and they fight or smth (shenhe wins easily). basically the point of this is to have chongyun accept that he&rsquo;s not dreaming and for shenhe to know that this isn&rsquo;t quite the same chongyun she&rsquo;s used to. (which is kind of a relief, bc at some point, someone&rsquo;s gonna have to bring up the fact that adeptus xiao is rumored to eat dreams, but chongyun would just be like, &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;no.&rdquo; lol) since neither of them have any idea what&rsquo;s going on, shenhe takes him to cloud retainer, who finds it most fascinating, indeed, and tells them to retrace his steps, at which point they return to wangshu inn, where they take the elevator up and travel yet another year into the future. shenhe senses </span><span class="c0 c1">something</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;about the elevator, but she can&rsquo;t quite place it. NOW xq is probably back out of his magical coma for like who knows how long, but when he sees chongyun and shenhe he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;oh god chongyun what are you doing with that violent woman&rdquo; and chongyun&rsquo;s like &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; but shenhe knows what&rsquo;s up and she just gives him a glare, and xq just scoffs and leaves w/o saying goodbye, probably saying smth under his breath that&rsquo;s like, dismissive of chongyun or w/e (maybe smth abt how it was a bad idea to come back here at this time of year considering the incident&rsquo;s anniversary or w/e) and yeah this is how chongyun finds out that even after xq wakes up from the magic coma, their relationship would STILL be permanently altered! anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t too obvious in the one-year-future bit, but now that they&rsquo;re two years into the future, chongyun suddenly notices that xq looks older. and when he looks in a mirror in wangshu inn, he realizes HE looks older, too. and NOW it dawns on him n shenhe that there is time travel going on, meaning chongyun&rsquo;s native timeline is a year before shenhe&rsquo;s native timeline. chongyun asks shenhe what xq was referring to when they briefly crossed paths in the inn just now, and shenhe finally tells him the details of The Incident in the marsh bc like. she&rsquo;s the only person who really can actually explain it to him, since it was just her and xingqiu out there, and xq was in a coma (and isn&rsquo;t speaking to him now). and chongyun&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;oh&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; bc he REALLY LIKES this aunt of his he&rsquo;s spent the last few days getting to know, but he understands why the versions of them from a year ago would have handled all this poorly. and like, shenhe would accept it if he stopped liking her after learning this, but chongyun is a hopeful boy, and he still strongly believes that all this can be fixed or averted like&hellip; somehow. anyway, so chongyun gets to have like, a heart-to-heart w/shenhe or smth abt the whole situation, bc to him, only like a week has passed AT MOST, but now here he is, seeing what his relationship to xingqiu might look like in two years, and that TERRIFIES him. he has to like, examine his whole relationship to xingqiu now, and what xingqiu means to him and what he wants to mean to xingqiu. and like, idk abt romantic feelings, but chongyun DOES know that no matter what they are, he wants to be together w/xingqiu. like maybe not lovers, he&rsquo;s not sure enough in his own feelings for that, but together. and shenhe, still not too familiar w/humany things like feelings, listens, but is unable to really give him advice, but that&rsquo;s all right, since he mostly just needed to talk to someone about it. so at this point, they probably realize that the elevator was the catalyst to the time travel, and now chongyun is faced with a few options. 1) he can stay here in this timeline two years removed from his original one and try to fix things now that he knows for certain that at least xq is alive and awake. however, all he can really do is try and hope he can fix everything that apparently happened in these two years that he has no memory of bc he didn&#39;t personally live through them bc Time Travel Bullshit Or Something. 2) go back one year and try to fix things before xq wakes back up, which would probably be easier, but still not ideal bc he would still have a year&#39;s gap in his memory; or 3) try to save his own timeline, but they don&#39;t quite know how to do that, since the elevator takes you Exactly One Year into the past and present, and obviously chongyun&rsquo;s had a few days pass in the future, and for various reasons, it&#39;s probably best that they don&#39;t go an extra year into the past and relive it just for this. in the end, it&rsquo;s getting late, and so he n shenhe sleep on it. the next morning, they take the elevator back to shenhe&rsquo;s timeline, bc chongyun knows that no matter what, he at least knows for certain that he doesn&rsquo;t wanna live in a timeline where he and xingqiu aren&rsquo;t friends anymore. they take the stairs back up, and they have to exorcize the thing in the elevator that is carrying people through time. shenhe stays at the top to do her half bc that IS her timeline, after all, and chongyun does his half on the ride down, bc he rather likes his aunt, and he&rsquo;d like for them to have a good relationship from the start. he doesn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll solve the xq accident thing, but he has to try. ANYWAY, so the elevator breaks on the way down, and so they have to cut the rope, resulting in it dropping a little bit below the one year mark before the exorcism is completed and the time travel aspect of the elevator is gone, meaning that chongyun can now run out to where he was supposed to meet xingqiu originally, out in dihua marsh, where xingqiu is like, &ldquo;ah, my dearest chongyun!!&rdquo; and then chongyun IMMEDIATELY gets to exorcizing the demon that was like, Actually Lurking there, and since despite years of practice, it IS still his first time executing it for realsies, so he almost slips, but then shenhe finally enters and they finish it off together, and now shenhe gets to meet chongyun for the first time due to time travel shenanigans hehehe. and so chongyun gets to start learning under shenhe, and he n xq have bff/maybe someday more adventures, and everyone lives happily ever after the end.

come from the time when marriage was the familial duty to connect lineages, not the emotionally intimate affair we know today. two girls whom the stars proclaim to be compatible sign a contract, vowing to know each other better than their own future husbands, providing each other with the love and support they need to survive. &lt;/br&gt; yanfei&rsquo;s laotong partnership provides her with the deep-heart companionship she craves, but there&rsquo;s another dimension to her feelings for hu tao that threaten to swallow her up if she doesn&rsquo;t figure out what they mean and make her want. is this perhaps why they describe having a laotong as being &lsquo;emotionally married&rsquo;&hellip;?&rdquo; </span><span class="c8 c0">anyway, yanfei and hu tao are laotong, and they grow up together and are very close, and then it starts having gay undertones, and so like idk cue yearning and careful navigation of this kind of intense emotional connection before slowly, the relationship becomes undeniably and irrevocably romantic, possibly without either of them even saying an outright word about it outside of closed doors. the way the girls get matched up as laotong is via granny ping, who decides that since yanfei is part adeptus and will likely have a longer lifespan than most mortals, hu tao the funeral director&rsquo;s granddaughter is a good match for her, since exposure to the fragile mortality of humans early on should acclimate yanfei to the idea of death being a normal part of life and all. but yeah so yanfei&rsquo;s father takes her down to the harbor to meet w/granny ping to arrange their laotong pairing, and it&rsquo;s yanfei&rsquo;s first time down in the city or something. the reason yanfei wants a laotong so badly is bc she was told that laotong is like getting emotionally married (to which her dad laughs and says that marriage as a matter of familial duty rather than an emotionally heartfelt choice is an old concept by now), and that laotong are meant to support each other and make each other happy throughout their whole lives, and didn&rsquo;t she sign a contract saying that she&rsquo;d live as happy a life as possible? and so her father relents, seeing that yanfei is serious, and they go down to the city blah blahb lah. taofei sign the contract, and soon after, yanfei&rsquo;s parents embark on their adventures across teyvat, leaving yanfei in granny ping&rsquo;s capable hands and yanfei a lot more time to spent w/her new laotong. the first time yanfei meets hu tao, though, she&rsquo;s getting into a Scrape, but manages to weasel her way out of it with the help of yanfei figuring out and exploiting some loopholes or whatever lol. yanfei usually likes to stick close to granny ping to study hard, which is why she doesn&rsquo;t become that close w/the liyue quartet like hu taowuwu. they definitely have like, a super gay sleepover like in snow flower one summer&mdash; probably the summer they become real adults, actually&mdash; which starts to shift yanfei&rsquo;s pov on the whole laotong situation. she thinks it&rsquo;ll just calm down again, but when it doesn&rsquo;t, she grows worried and decides to go to her cousin ganyu for advice, since she&rsquo;s noticed something similar happening between her and that new yuheng recently, this emotionally charged relationship that, while obviously complex in nature, also seems to have a deeper connection going on. ganyu gets flustered when yanfei asks her abt it, then admits that she&#39;s not quite sure of it herself, but it&#39;s the sort of relationship she&#39;s wanted for a long time now, but she&#39;s insecure abt whether or not it&#39;ll work out bc they started out with such opposing viewpoints what if keqing just doesn&#39;t see her that way&hellip; this probably happens after rex lapis&rsquo;s death. oh maybe the gay sleepover happens when his funeral preparations are going on, and they find comfort in one another as they grieve. and then yanfei pauses and ponders for a while and has a good long discussion on what feelings mean in which contexts and why they mean the things they do. probably at some point after their relationship irrevocably changes into smth more romantic (ardent?), or maybe after rex lapis&rsquo;s death, before they learn it was faked and all, yanfei quietly asks hu tao if she&rsquo;d like to live as long as an adeptus does. it&rsquo;s an offer, something her mother had taken up when marrying her father, and now with the death of the geo archon, yanfei feels a little frightened of losing other people who&rsquo;d become assumed constants in her life, like her parents or hu tao. but hu tao is like, &ldquo;nope!&rdquo; bc she&rsquo;s happy to live as long as fate has allotted, no more and no less. and then it gets into the idea that as people, they have to make the most of their time alive because they have to make it mean something on their own. this is why adepti are so venerated, why their lives mean so much to those they watch over and guide: although they too will someday die as well, they have a long, long time to make something of themselves, define themselves. but yanfei, you are human too, and you promised your father you&rsquo;d live as happy a life as possible. do not dwell on the sadness of death, for the land of the dead is not a lonely place. the land of the living after the passing of a loved one doesn&rsquo;t have to be lonely, either. everyone dies someday, and while i hu tao will be crossing the border without looking back the moment i arrive, know i will look forward to the day you join me as well. and then yanfei cries, overwhelmed, and tackles hu tao into a hug, and they KISS for like the first time probably bc the times before were probably more like, subtle hints or weren&rsquo;t on the lips or w/e. this kiss is more like a declaration of intent, one that essentially makes good on all the promises they made in their contract all those years ago, because although one side was written on regular red paper, they chose to paste it atop/combine it with joss paper (y&rsquo;know, the paper that gets burned at funerals to send things to your ancestors in the afterlife) to acknowledge the fact that one of them is nearly immortal and the other, a regular girl who will die someday, and they use joss paper so that they can carry their promises even into the afterlife. like yeah that&rsquo;s probably seen as bad luck, to make the promises of a lifetime on the stuff you burn when you die, but hu tao is already a transgressive person so it&rsquo;s Fine, Actually lol. - COMPLETE</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">i would if i could (but i can&rsquo;t so i don&rsquo;t).</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;xiaoven. abt how they both hold back for what they believe to be each other&rsquo;s sakes, resulting in this kind of unspoken line they each want the other to cross (just </span><span class="c0 c1">desperately</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so), but xiao is repressed as hell and doesn&rsquo;t think he deserves to ask anything of venti, who has already given him so much; and venti doesn&rsquo;t want to feel like he&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">asking</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;anything of xiao bc he fears that his godhood will be the only reason xiao acts at all, and he&rsquo;s not the god of freedom to </span><span class="c0 c1">order </span><span class="c0">things of people. like after a few centuries of yearning and pining and complaining to zhongli, they ofc manage to carefully, </span><span class="c0 c1">painstakingly</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;cross over the high walls they&rsquo;ve built around themselves for each other specifically (hence completing the quote&mdash;

second chapter &ldquo;and i can so i will&rdquo; and it focuses on how the world changes around them, and they must change with it, and with those changes gives them the ability to finally admit their feelings for each other lol. </span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">adulthood. </span><span class="c0">hu tao character study(?). possibly minor yantao. titled after the jukebox the ghost song and its line, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">from adulthood, no one survives</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo; abt hu tao&rsquo;s grandfather dying and her journey into the afterlife to find him in vain. ofc this earns her her vision, and she becomes the peppy funeral director we know today, which quickly gets her a poor reputation. she then meets the other kids in town (liyue quartet/quintet if you include yun jin), and since they&rsquo;re kids, they don&rsquo;t really care that she&rsquo;s weird bc that just makes her fun, so even though she&rsquo;s a middle teen now, she feels free to act as she wants. then, she meets yanfei, who, as a young prodigy studying to be a legal advisor, begins to work closely w/their funeral parlor bc paperwork and stuff. yanfei feels kind of like a stick in the mud to hu tao at this age, who, while doing all the rituals correctly and with the sobriety they deserve, is still genuinely too irreverent for it to feel like she understands the </span><span class="c0 c1">intent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the rituals&mdash; she&rsquo;s just doing a damn good job playing pretend bc she&rsquo;s a damn good actor/mimic, but she doesn&rsquo;t fully understand why people grieve or mourn or have rituals around death at all. she&rsquo;s still rather childlike in that regard. yanfei, whose passions stem from understanding the law and the people, </span><span class="c0 c1">must</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;understand the intent behind each law, or else she cannot be a good legal practitioner, and this difference btwn understanding the intents behind each of their passions is what puts the two of them in a mild conflict of just not really understanding each other. then, as she comes of age, rex lapis dies, and the role of his funerary rites is thrust upon hu tao, with the help of zhongli and yanfei, ofc. the traveler is probably there too, but they&rsquo;re off doing fetch quests as wangsheng prepares other rituals. because yanfei is part adeptus, the loss of rex lapis hits her much more personally than other people bc he was like her beloved uncle, and hu tao sees her truly grieve for the first time. they&rsquo;ve grown to get along by now, since yanfei can at least </span><span class="c0 c1">see</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that hu tao can do things seriously when the time calls for it, but bc they&rsquo;re friends now, hu tao wants to provide some sort of comfort to yanfei as she grieves, which she only knows how to do through a joke. however, it&rsquo;s not the right moment for such a thing, and yanfei lashes out, asking hu tao how she can&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on here. and hu tao is just like, &ldquo;well, everyone dies someday; he lived a very long and fulfilling life. that&rsquo;s worth celebrating.&rdquo; but for all that yanfei knows this to be true, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to alleviate her grief. so now the time has come for hu tao to start examining her philosophy on death, start figuring out why people grieve at all. while she can also reflect on how she copes with this sort of thing herself, and she starts to realize that she&rsquo;s still very much a child in how she grieves. she realizes that grief is just another form of love, that mourning, while sad, is how people express that love. the rituals people perform for the deceased extend beyond just the funerary services she provides: they start from the moment the body is discovered. while she&rsquo;s right and people DO need to lighten up abt death/post-mortem discussions when everyone is still alive, safe, and well, the rituals she oversees are an expression of love. while she </span><span class="c0 c1">knows</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;what exists on the other side of this world, she&rsquo;s been treating the knowledge more flippantly than she&rsquo;d like to admit, using it as an excuse to keep people from properly grieving (which also makes her realize she never understood the </span><span class="c0 c1">spirit</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;of some of their funerary rites&mdash; like that one comment she made abt tossing a few bodies into the crematories at once to make them go by faster; post-chara dev hu tao would def cringe at that memory). </span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">GI. eimiko. gamer AU. ei n makoto are partners for some competitive game and they&#39;re meant to go to a tournament together, but then makoto gets pulled off to do smth else, so ei must enlist the help of her neighbor girl gamer girl yae to be her partner instead. meanwhile, her kid brother scaramouche is jealous bc he wanted to take over makoto&#39;s spot instead, and so he joins the fatui to sabotage the event, and by kid brother, i mean he&rsquo;s like ten or twelve years old lmao. </span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. xiaoven. reincarnation AU of sorts. insp </span><span class="c7 c0 c1"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archiveofourown.org/works/4059037&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715494425798652&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eSupOs2mDoZmTLmdd_dpg">silhouettes</a></span><span class="c7 c0"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archiveofourown.org/works/4059037&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1715494425798783&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QS4i_usvuQ_LvmH-FuZxS">&nbsp;by jelly</a></span><span class="c8 c0">, aka the fic that used the long, empty paragraphs to impress upon me this Very Particular Vibe that i then integrated into my own writing style. xiao&rsquo;s a young working adult or smth in the modern world, feeling sort of adrift in the world, when he begins to dream of different times, of different lives, where he chases the particular sound of a flute that he can never seem to perfectly recreate himself, and this boy, it seems, with bright eyes and a mischievous smile, whom he swears he&rsquo;s never met before but a part of him aches for every time. and venti (bc ofc it&rsquo;s venti) never seems to be much more than a brief glimpse, maybe a laugh or a fleeting touch, before he vanishes seemingly into the wind. xiao drifts through the waking world, quietly observing the people he knows and the lives they lead, talks to his mentor zhongli a bit, but never in much detail. he&rsquo;s simply too shy to. there are legends of a time when teyvat had magic which xiao has never cared for before, but when one day he sees a glimpse of the boy in his dreams on the cover of a mondstadt history book, he finds himself pulled in. and so he finds himself devoting more and more of himself to learning more abt this song and the boy from his dreams, but they never seem to relate to each other (bc this is a part of liyue&rsquo;s history, not mond&rsquo;s), until one day, ganyu points out how unusual it is for xiao to be interested in smth outside of liyue. xiao probably dismisses her, but the idea of it sticks w/him nevertheless, and it starts bugging him, too. and like, in silhouettes, at least there was a tangible endpoint of &ldquo;get annie out of the crystal&rdquo; but if venti just fades into the wind, i have NO idea how the power of love might get them out of this tbh.</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. hear me out on this one&mdash; </span><span class="c0 c1">early-to-mid-2000s fandom AU. </span><span class="c0">though i guess since this pitch is no plot all vibes it really could be any fandom BUT IT&rsquo;S FINE bc it&rsquo;s funny. it would be kind of fun to do stylistically, since it would probably be best presented as digital epistolary and to my knowledge, most fandom at the time took place on livejournal, yahoo groups, mailing lists, and geocities, absolutely NONE of which i was there for. lj was like, the personal socializing/posting site for fandom, though you had communities which acted kind of like forums. from what i&rsquo;ve observed, yahoo groups functioned basically like lj communities, except it didn&rsquo;t have the option of having anonymous message boards like lj&rsquo;s failfandom-anon. geocities and personal fansites i think were where webrings happened, and they were highly customizable and hard to find. anyway, it would be really funny if each of the seven nations of teyvat were like, a different major archive covering different aspects of the same fandom, and each of the archons was like, the archive&rsquo;s owner. star said she Knows ganqing would be on opposite ends of fandom drama, and i agree, which means in this case they are mods on zhongli&rsquo;s fandom archive, and zhongli has gone like radio silent and no one can contact him, which is bad bc he owns the servers, and now liyue archive is starting to realize that they&rsquo;re gonna have to take the reins to preserve the archive or move it to a new domain. i&rsquo;m not sure how to chart out the differences btwn humans n adepti into this kind of situation&mdash; maybe bnf and nnf? would be interesting to have this take place around the time of strikethrough then&mdash; DOES THIS MEAN ZHONGLI GOT HIT BY STRIKETHROUGH??? GRANDPA WHAT ARE YOU DOING&mdash; where you have that transition of power away from bnf with the emergence of ao3, whose equivalent in this au would be something like teyvatarchival or smth. omg the adepti are mods on the liyue archive who were handpicked by zhongli (and are thus usually bnf, but in the case of xiao, not all), whereas the qixing are mods on the liyue archive comprised of people who applied for modhood and were voted in by lurkers/readers and have thus risen to namehood. anyway, so their conflict is over who is gonna take zhongli&rsquo;s place as the maintainer of the archive, if they&rsquo;re gonna migrate and if they are then to where. and also osial n the old gods or w/e are well-known fandom trolls who WILL try to attack the archive if they hear wind of it (CHILDE&hellip;), so they also have to act fast before they lose all their shit permanently. which i guess really just makes this a retelling of the canon liyue arc set in a pre-ao3 internet fandom era. if this becomes a series i want it called smth like </span><span class="c0 c1">teyvat.livejournal.com</span><span class="c0">. does this imply that khaenri&rsquo;ah was, like, a rogue fan site that hosted all this stuff the powers that be (celestia) didn&rsquo;t like (y&rsquo;know, like the controversial porn that was most frequently targeted and purged) and issued a very publicized takedown notice that became very controversial w/in the teyvat fandom that no one dared speak out abt un-anon bc like&hellip; well that&rsquo;s tptb. we don&rsquo;t wanna get smote too. i feel like the archons being archive maintainers while celestia are tptb has absolutely FASCINATING implications as well, like the seven nations of teyvat are, like, showrunner-sanctioned archives, and the archons have the power and ability to actually talk to the creators. who knows if they&rsquo;ll listen, but they have the POWER to do so. (though i guess it would probably make more sense that it&rsquo;s more like tptb are fully aware of each of the seven archives and has contacted them personally w/a list of rules they must abide by in order to avoid receiving a takedown notice, and also an nda agreement to not talk abt their contact, although eventually the fact that the archive maintainers are in contact w/tptb does transpire n become common diffused knowledge sort of thing) this DOES mean that venti has like eighty sock puppet accounts to avoid holding power over the people who use his site, which he inherited from his older brother at a pretty young age (fifteen, sixteen? he&rsquo;s probably like college age/just out of college in this au) when the fandom was in its infancy&mdash; he probably just inherited a domain name that coincidentally became coveted by the fandom and got involved from there. ei and makoto shared an account bc ei wasn&rsquo;t invested enough in the fandom to make her own acct, but she still wanted to participate in smth her sister loved albeit lurkingly, until smth happens irl that pulls makoto away from fandom (most likely an accident fully incapacitating her for an unknown period of time) and ei must take on her sister&rsquo;s online identity whilst also keeping their kid brother from getting in trouble online. and like, just thinking abt this as an au is so funny to me. the liyue quartet would be there, writing fic online as like the ABSOLUTE YOUNGEST people on the site at 16-17, and they understandably hold like zero power as a result. all the power n drama would be happening btwn fully grown adults in their late twenties/early thirties, which sounds batshit to me, a twenty-year-old in fandom, but like, bored housewives, man. zhongli&rsquo;s like some middle-aged widower who is chill with fandom bc he&rsquo;s too old and wise to have shame. it would probably be weird if ganyu n xiao were his actual children, but he absolutely had an influence in their online life growing up by virtue of being the guy who runs the liyue archive. xiao lurks on the mondstadt site w/o an acct even though he knows he can just make an acct n lurk like a normal person bc some of the stuff hosted there (probably produced by venti lol) got him through his shitty high school life. albedo n xq collab on fan content. inazuma probably does the fandom event roundups and hosting actually, like big bangs or smth, probably known for hosting fanart? liyue is known for hosting the fic. mond is known for hosting the podfic/fan compositions n stuff. sumeru </span><span class="c33 c0">is known for meta essays</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;HOSTS THE WIKI HOW COULD I FORGET THE WIKI, natlan is known for hot n spicy debate n forums/the anonymous message boards. fontaine will probably be the video hosters (unless that was liyue for its money, in which case inazuma &rarr; fic n fontaine &rarr; fandom calendars n stuff) and god knows what snez will be known for. like obvs all the archives have a bit of each, but they have reputations for each different type of fan content/interaction. oh my god it would be really funny if visions basically translated into the type of fan content each person made. fanfic writer childe&hellip;

another high school failure when he stops showing up one day, and then we skip to when he&rsquo;s in college. maybe he&rsquo;s doing an exchange thing or w/e, but anyway, he ends up deciding to get a

(maybe mischief/persona he usually has as venti the drunkard bard?) &rarr; savior figure &rarr; war criminal/archon war venti [who let(?) his friends die/leave (from his persp anyway)] &rarr; barbatos &rarr; identity issues venti &rarr; ~cured~ and by ~cured~ i mean the acknowledgement that these are all but </span><span class="c0 c1">facets</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of venti&rsquo;s character, and none of them define him fully. anyway, starts off w/the playful (drunkard) wind calling xiao&rsquo;s name, (maybe even calling him &ldquo;my love&rdquo; lol) bc that&rsquo;s the persona he usually uses to get people to like him, but when all that does is confuse xiao, who finds no charm to fall in love with a disembodied breeze, venti materializes in his usual form, except instead of a harp or lyre, he carries a flute w/him specifically. and xiao sees it and freezes up, bc they </span><span class="c0 c1">never</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;acknowledge the dihua flute moment&mdash; he&rsquo;s never brought it up, out of fear that venti had forgotten it or didn&rsquo;t find it as personal or meaningful as he did&mdash; and venti presents himself as someone who can help xiao, save him from himself/his own karmic debts, if he were to simply lay down his burdens. essentially, venti is trying to make himself seem </span><span class="c0 c1">needed</span><span class="c0">, which he will accept in place of being </span><span class="c0 c1">wanted </span><span class="c0">as himself. but xiao, while feeling the tug of desire to lay down his burdensome duty and dance in a field of flowers, he looks his way, swallows hard, and refuses. the people need protecting, he says, and i do not wish to leave them in harm&rsquo;s way, which basically just acknowledges that he is </span><span class="c0 c1">capable</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of having desires, at least ones that aren&rsquo;t selfish. and from there, venti says smth along the lines of still fighting in a war, and his appearance changes to that of exactly the nameless bard&mdash; the teal in his braids darkens to black, and his eyes turn blue and take on a slightly harder look&mdash; and essentially shows his power as an archon, how he&rsquo;s not as weak and helpless as he likes to position himself, and offers to clean up the last of liyue&rsquo;s problems for xiao, so that he may be free from his duty, perhaps. essentially, this is the side of venti that wants to protect xiao, wants so desperately for him to be free, so that they can be together, because he also </span><span class="c0 c1">knows</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that he can </span><span class="c0 c1">lose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;xiao so, so easily. and for as tempting as it is, xiao still says no, because he doesn&rsquo;t want venti to carry his burdens for him. these sins do not belong to venti, don&rsquo;t belong to him, either, but he has willingly agreed to take them on anyway. (subtly, it is xiao wanting to protect venti as well.) and there&rsquo;s this unreadable, almost hurt look in venti&rsquo;s eyes, and he approaches xiao, reaches out to touch him w/his bare hands for the first time since their meeting that day began, and he shifts into his archon form? or maybe he just sinks down into the grass and asks xiao to lie down with him, which xiao does comply with. and they talk about xiao&rsquo;s self-denial, like, just straight-up, venti is like, &ldquo;sweet adeptus, why do you deny yourself [pleasure/relief]?&rdquo; and xiao, quietly, is smth like, &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t [think?] i deserve such things.&rdquo; bc it&rsquo;s not that he doesn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c0 c1">want</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it, but to ask for it, or even accept it consciously when it&rsquo;s been offered to him, feels like too much, almost a sin, when he sees himself as undeserving of goodness bc of his past. which triggers venti&rsquo;s next transformation into his archon form, and next thing xiao knows, he&rsquo;s staring up at venti, who has him caged in w/his arms, and venti says smth like, &ldquo;i think you deserve it.&rdquo; the archon form is, as i mentioned before, the part w/the kinda&hellip; you know what, i don&rsquo;t think they can really be called </span><span class="c0 c1">horny </span><span class="c0">vibes specifically, but the weight of intimacy btwn them is nearly </span><span class="c0 c1">crushing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the atmosphere. smth smth this form comes from the impression that </span><span class="c0 c25">xiao is a rather submissive/obedient character who also denies himself things that would make him feel good, so venti basically offers himself up? i guess you could say? as a willing sexual partner to someone who would both never ask for it first, nor accept it if it was offered lightly, or even in earnest by his usual personality bc xiao thinks venti deserves better, and venti doesn&rsquo;t wanna push him into smth he&rsquo;s already refused.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and venti definitely says, &ldquo;i love you&rdquo; here at some point, and both characters can </span><span class="c0 c1">feel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it in the air, how much he truly </span><span class="c0 c1">means</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. and xiao is kind of stunned silent by the situation and is overwhelmed by the types of desire that come with it, so much so that it basically forces him to accept it rather than just notice n reject/suppress it, but he still shakes his head no or answers in confusion, bc he&rsquo;s just really not sure what the hell is up w/venti in this situation, n even if he&rsquo;s the one pinned down or w/e, he doesn&rsquo;t wanna take advantage of the situation, which is what has venti sigh n turn into the aforementioned wind wisp. the wisp is essentially venti defeated, and he sighs abt his pathetic nature/abilities, n xiao carefully holds him in both his hands n is like, &ldquo;but i care for you just as you are. [bc i love you]&rdquo; bc his character development is abt accepting his own desires n voicing them. and wind-sprite venti stills, quiet for a moment, then, in a magical transformation of anemo glitter and wind, he turns back into himself&mdash; for real this time and not the savior undercover archon bard&mdash; and drapes his arms around xiao, maybe buries his head into his shoulder or the crook of his neck, and asks him if he really means that. and the words sit heavy inside of xiao&rsquo;s throat; his hands hover just shy of hugging venti back n holding him in his arms. he&rsquo;s afraid of admitting to his earnestness in the face of very much the real venti, of showing vulnerability to </span><span class="c0 c1">anyone</span><span class="c8 c0">, but slowly, carefully, as if the archon was made of spun glass, he holds venti close n says yes. - COMPLETE</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. </span><span class="c0 c1">what queer sins taint thy soul? </span><span class="c0">xiaoven. college/early adulthood roommates AU. featuring demisexual xiao C:&lt; anyway, so xiao has gone through his teen years identifying very solidly as just totally asexual. he&rsquo;s now in his early 20s, finishing up college and rooming with one of the people in (the already graduated, mind you) zhongli&rsquo;s year, venti, who is still finishing up his first degree even though he&rsquo;s in his mid-to-late 20s. they have been roommates since xiao&rsquo;s second year of college, after zhongli his senpai graduated and basically passed along his ex-roommate lol. this entire time, venti&rsquo;s ended up growing on xiao, kind of like moss, and they&rsquo;ve ended up fairly close, all things considered. venti sleeps in xiao&rsquo;s bed sometimes, in an arguably no-homo way. anyway, similar to the other demisexual xiao pitch in that he starts realizing </span><span class="c0 c25">he wants to have sex with his roommate</span><span class="c0 c39">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which is obviously pretty mortifying, but the difference here is that the modern au gives him a slightly different framework than canonverse. here, he has a sexuality that he&rsquo;s given name to and is part of his identity. it </span><span class="c0 c1">has been</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;part of his identity for a number of years by this point!!

most of the narrative happens in the a/n as conversations btwn venti and the &ldquo;author&rdquo; (aka istaroth) after the &ldquo;author&rdquo; notices smth going on w/her writer&rsquo;s block or w/e, discovers venti in the a/n (and up until this point, it has been kept from the readers why some of the a/n are in &lt;code&gt; tags (that&rsquo;s venti, usually commenting on the events) and some aren&rsquo;t (that&rsquo;s istaroth, usually replying to comments ffn style via the a/n at the start)). venti, at the start, has only just become aware bc of god of time roots or w/e idk he just does he&rsquo;s the blorbo who has come alive bc he is now the vehicle istaroth uses to explore her own queerness out of sight of society (aka celestia) via yaoi. anyway, basically, most of the first few a/n are written by venti, but eventually he gets in contact w/the &ldquo;author&rdquo; and demands to know why they keep making xv suffer like this (bc a conclusion i came to when reading the yaoizine is that. yaoi is very miserable, which helps differentiate it from the Vibes of things like BL. but, it&rsquo;s that misery n toxicity in relationships that compel people, bc through the misery, there&rsquo;s like, this endless hope and longing within for stuff like beauty and connection. but it&rsquo;s beautifully delicious dramatic irony to the reader, who Knows that there will be no happy ending really, bc their fate is simply to be miserable, yet endlessly hoping that maybe things will get better, maybe they can fix this if they just </span><span class="c0 c1">tried</span><span class="c0">&mdash; and that is the appeal. yaoi is miserable, yet it has this dramatic irony around hope that makes it cathartic). this goes on for several chapters, cue metanarrative abt &ldquo;author&rdquo; coming to terms w/their own relationship to queerness (thus carrying on the time-honored tradition of exploring one&rsquo;s own sexuality through gay fanfiction fuck yeah). eventually, the way they get out is that the &ldquo;author&rdquo; accepts that they can be queer and have happy endings too; life does not always have to have a tragic end even if it feels like it now, even if it feels like that&rsquo;s all society will ever let us have. </span><span class="c1 c24">we are not doomed to the fates that others seem to write onto us. </span><span class="c0">having the &ldquo;author&rdquo; be </span><span class="c0">istaroth</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would be really cool, since canonically, she&rsquo;s kind of his mom in that he split off from her as a thread of the thousand winds, and similarly, by having him be her blorbo in this metafic, onto whom she projects her own fears of fate, feels fitting. bc this is a deeply meta narrative that can only be brought to its fullest potential on ao3 (rather than printed media or like, basically anywhere else), this also kind of brings up the question as to how to deal w/comments n stuff. the answer is, ofc, to just answer them in the a/n at the start like it&rsquo;s ffn, in-character as the &ldquo;author&rdquo; aka istaroth. the summary should imply nothing abt the metanarrative, but the tags absolutely </span><span class="c0 c1">should</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;without just saying everything outright (i.e. relationships is only xiao/venti, but istaroth is included in the characters, as is &ldquo;metanarrative&rdquo; in the freeforms on the work itself, while the bookmark has its bookmark tags tagging the whole thing more rigorously/honestly). all this is bc i want to force the audience to realize that they are participatory in Art, not merely casual observers or consumers of it. equal parts fanfic and performance art BABEYYYYY. anyway, back to the author/istaroth having Queer Revelations through her conversations w/venti, definitely steal that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s definitely a gendered aspect to my fascination w/[xv smut as a concept]&rdquo; monologue i had at nat last september. there&rsquo;s also, like, some mentions of batshit stuff istaroth is up to irl that speaks much more to her queerness (dealing with stuff like comphet, or gender dysphoria, or both! probably more too!), and depending on the point in the fic, she might force venti ooc in their a/n dialogues in order to tell her off (bc she&rsquo;s actually telling herself off blahblahblah). also we need to have at least fake one oneshot where xv are catboys in maid costumes, and it would be SO CRINGE bc of how completely over-the-top and earnest it is. it&rsquo;s not the happy ending (bc venti is allergic to cats), but i guess it would be good practice for istaroth to, like, test out self-indulgence in a fluffy, rather than angsty, way? it fails as the happy ending that lets xv escape bc it lacks the catharsis she was trying to get from the tragic endings bc there&rsquo;s very little struggle or even plot to the maid caf&eacute; catboy xvs. also poor xiao he&rsquo;s just the other half of the ship in this fic lmao. also smth smth, the hypothetical fics always end right before venti can take the story into his own hands, and there comes an argument w/istaroth abt it n the idea of agency, and &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not </span><span class="c0 c1">supposed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to take control of your own life! [how are you supposed to know what you really want when you haven&rsquo;t lived that long to know what you like?]&rdquo; as a reflection of the lack of agency a lot of queer teenagers feel like they have. considering how sexual yaoi tends to be, probably would also have at least one argument abt top/bottom dynamics n stereotypes like, &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t mean to sound ungrateful or anything, but why is it that i&rsquo;m always on the bottom&rdquo; &rarr; criticism of the expectation for queer relationships to look a certain way, discussion abt how the point of sex and intimacy is not guilt or shame (where does that even come from?) or control, not necessarily abt reproduction or w/e, but like, usually it&rsquo;s supposed to be fun and enjoyable. why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? also, unrelated, but it would be </span><span class="c0 c1">really</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;funny if this was basically The Fic where i get to subvert the usual xv roles, and xiao is an accessory to venti angst while venti is an accessory to xiao smut. it would probably work!!!! xiao doesn&rsquo;t rlly get to be self-aware, n assuming i finally shed the shame or w/e to Write The Sex, then the hypothetical oneshots n stuff could probably pull that off!</span></li><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">GI. ganqing.

nations for school. just make it so that all vision-bearers attend this school at some point. which, when considering our #fuckcelestia agenda, now becomes sus as fuck! what are they doing w/all the allogenes then, hmmm? and obviously 4nemo/5wirl have all already been mentioned to be running away from home in some way&mdash; in venti&rsquo;s case, he&rsquo;s &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to run away by his current, like, guardian or w/e even tho they&rsquo;re legal adults. but surely he&rsquo;s got friends from mond like jean, kaeya, diluc, who care abt him, right? unless smth </span><span class="c0 c1">happens</span><span class="c8 c0">&nbsp;if he returns to mond n they all know it&hellip;

they know they&rsquo;re gonna have bitches who make it their job to snoop around their affairs, n after venti gets caught in the air vents, they force him into a deal or otherwise restrict him in some way. maybe they threaten xiao in some way! and if venti says he&rsquo;ll just break up w/xiao or smth, they escalate to threatening all of mond, which definitely shuts venti up. however, he doesn&rsquo;t give up, esp when the traveler seems to be starting up their own adventure in investigating seemingly entirely unrelated mysteries pertaining to the school. like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up w/the chasm? dragonspine? &hellip;enkanomiya&hellip;? what the&hellip;&rdquo; n gradually, they uncover some of the secrets celestia have been so carefully hiding away, like the fact that they are not the true rulers of teyvat, but in fact, The Second Who Came, n there&rsquo;s evidence pointing towards the fact that if we&rsquo;re going by the Divine Right of Kings for w/e reason, then VENTI is the true heir of the land. which. &ldquo;no, thank you,&rdquo; he says. </span></li><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">old mond probably has smth underneath its tower that only venti can access for some reason, n it&rsquo;s like, probably the record of some prophecy (if that wasn&rsquo;t already the thing that venti stumbled across in the admin&rsquo;s attic that forced his hand&mdash; oh what if he did that snooping BEFORE the lantern rite arc, n he gets banned from mond, where the rest of the prophecy or w/e is kept as a result, which is why he was going to stay in the dorms for break anyway??) that divines the role of the traveler as well as seven-ish others in the fall of celestia. oh, this could be where the twin thing n cycles could come in, bc lumine could have tried to form a similar party n either failed or formed the abyss order as a result, paralleling amotodan in their prophecy thing.</span></li><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">prophecy is of traveler + seven companions who each contribute smth to the fall of celestia in some way&mdash; n obvs, i want there to be one of each element going on, so that technically keeps xv from both being the prophesied characters. i&rsquo;m leaning more towards venti being kicked out of this particular prophecy group despite being the one who discovers it n stuff (so that i can distance xiao for ANGST!!!), but maybe he still exists as the instigator of events. but anyway:</span></li><li class="c23 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0"></span></li></ol><a id="t.7f3d714828543d808115e3fd240197aeaebc8ba5"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c38"><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">CHAR</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">NATION</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">ELEMENT</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">kaeya</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">mond</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">cryo</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">xiao</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">liyue</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">anemo</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">itto?</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">inazuma</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">geo</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">nahida?</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">sumeru</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">dendro</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">lyney</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">fontaine</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">pyro</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">???</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">natlan</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">electro</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c13"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">childe</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">snezhnaya</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c8 c0">hydro</span></p></td></tr></table><ol class="c5 lst-kix_d7w0c1ypmcra-1" start="8"><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">mond could have kaeya, albedo, or lisa. inazuma is v. difficult bc most of their chars feel v. disconnects from the main genshin plot or have their elements already represented (like kokomi).... yae miko maybe, or ayaka, but they don&rsquo;t really seem the type, just for various reasons. plus, kaeya n ayaka would be mutually exclusive picks due to elements. i don&rsquo;t want ei to be the prophesied one here bc i want makoto to have been a part of lumine&rsquo;s team (w/the other prev. gen of the Seven? n then lumine considered herself the anemo n possibly DAINSLIEF as the eighth?? food for thought!) n ei fears too much to take part in the new generation herself, though she&rsquo;s willing to turn a blind eye n offer what little knowledge she does have via yae. nahida is obvs second gen in this, but her mother&rsquo;s disappearance is also like a whole Thing&trade;. </span></li><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">but anyway, just bc there are only seven prophesied party members, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the other chars, are, like, entirely irrelevant! we will obvs be having cynonari family happening somewhere, though i guess i gotta start thinking abt what counts as &ldquo;campus&rdquo; and &ldquo;country&rdquo; here bc picking n choosing who&rsquo;s college-aged n stuff is getting crazy. maybe this is a reincarnation AU too, wherein celestia wiped everyone&rsquo;s memories n buried all the ley line trees so that people couldn&rsquo;t retrieve their records (...except via old mond n stormterror&rsquo;s lair, which wasn&rsquo;t sealed off, unlike the other nations&rsquo; potential ley line locations bc venti was not part of lumine&rsquo;s team). </span></li><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8 c0">also like, smth smth abt the gnoses n the ley lines, n collecting them like the dragonballs, n the reason lumine&rsquo;s team had failed was bc they didn&rsquo;t have the anemo gnosis, but aether&rsquo;s team, as they encounter n ally w/the other former Seven, do end up w/them all. how they get past venti being banned from mond is anyone&rsquo;s guess. maybe xv will just power of love their way through. </span></li></ol><ol class="c5 lst-kix_d7w0c1ypmcra-0" start="853"><li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">GI. xiaoven. revolutionary girl utena AU. xiao as anthy n then venti as utena. although, granted, rgu&rsquo;s story is </span><span class="c0 c1">very intrinsically tied</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the oppression of womanhood n the unlivability of the various feminine archetypes n patriarchy n all that stuff, so Maybe this won&rsquo;t work as well with a m/m pairing if i also want to honor the themes n thesis of rgu, at least when it comes to gender. but i do still think that they can pull it off when it comes to themes of agency and self-actualization. but anyway, xiao&rsquo;s old master as tokio would make sense. considering how few sibling pairs we have in gnshn for realsies (and also just. personal discomfort w/playing w/the gnshn chars like that lol) might try to replace the explicit incest w/smth else. ei as juri might be a lot of fun tho. OR YAE AS JURI except that the love interest (in this case ei) being painfully heterosexual, hence distance and yearning, smthsmth makoto died, and for w/e reason, ei&rsquo;s been saddled w/a young child (scaramouche) (whose origins are never explained) and is just generally distant w/grief. anyway, it&rsquo;s possible that lyney n lynette could be mickey n his sister, esp. considering pre-vision lyney asking for a delusion n all that stuff. maybe make the fic not as tragic as the original in general? like yeah ofc they fucking suffer, but gradually, they all learn their hard lessons, just as utena does in the show itself, and break their various cycles of abuse. BUT LIKE ANYWAY i think it would be a fun character arc for venti to go through the same shit as utena, where at first he&rsquo;s making demands of xiao w/o realizing what he&rsquo;s doing, then gradually changing as he struggles to make his ideals into his own (the nameless bard is, like, arguably the spirit of dios here, but we are going to sever that idealism of princehood from the mastermind at the end of the world in this situation? though that kind of defeats the purpose of &lsquo;gender roles are fucked all the way down you can&rsquo;t idealize your way out of a flawed system bc you&rsquo;re romanticizing smth that doesn&rsquo;t exist&rsquo;...), and eventually, xiao becomes more n more able to assert his own desires n shit. anyway smthsmth rather than xiao being the &lsquo;rose bride&rsquo; or w/e definitely want his title to have smth to do w/songbirds.
