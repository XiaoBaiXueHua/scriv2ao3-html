  <li>if yaoi metanarrative, <em><span class="s1">cazzo</span></em> is also to be the final chapter</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>after they go at it, like, once, venti ofc cuddles xiao close and praises him effusively. then he sticks his fingers into xiao’s mouth and talks, all daydreamy, about how he wants to fuck xiao really badly now too, and that’s the point where they get to switch lol</li>
  <li>probably no wing kink in this one. feels kind of late to let them out now, and also i think it’s been established by this point that xiao just doesn’t have them anymore. so unless venti’s gonna let his own out! nah</li>
  <li>but venti definitely still runs his hands all over that part of xiao’s back that v. few— if any at all aside from venti!!— are allowed to touch, just due to Trauma reasons. and i think xiao would enjoy that kind of intimacy and exploring the novel feelings and experiences it can bring</li>
  <li>other notes to self include the fact that it’s playing very heavily into self-indulgent fantasies about sex, where realism is like, kind of the opposite of the goal in a sense! i don’t want to have to think about all the ~healthy~ communication that would be good for them to have during sex i want them to already know each other’s cues so well that they can do things to each other without asking in a way that would probably seem dubious in a real-life situation but gets romanticized bc they love each other and That Is What Matters bc that also magically means they understand each other’s boundaries without saying anything</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br /></p>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>blahblahblah venti puts xiao’s fingers in his mouth and it should be written with the same attn and sensuality as one would otherwise write sucking dick; xiao definitely feels some kind of way about it lol. </li>
    <li>think that one scene in flip flappers where cocona pricks her finger in the time loop and papika immediately puts it in her mouth and cocona’s like “<strong><span class="s2">uhhhhh</span></strong>” bc she’s definitely not <em><span class="s1">opposed</span></em> to it but she also doesn’t want to <em><span class="s1">admit</span></em> that.</li>
    <li>anyway yeah blahblahblah spit as lube anal fingering— unlike the “bite me”, this is not smth venti explicitly asks for; it’s more like xiao was gonna start idly doing it anyway when he was preoccupied with sucking venti’s nipples (weird that that’s the thing i’m shy about typing out), but venti definitely would have been like, “aiya, not like that—” and grab xiao’s wrist to put his fingers in his mouth first. maybe he gives a wink and a blep when he’s done, v flirtatious lol</li>
    <li>anyway fingering goes on (xiao is v. pleased with all the pretty sounds and breathy moans he has venti making) until at some point venti either takes xiao’s face in his hands or wraps his arms around xiao’s neck— either way he pulls xiao closer and the latter thinks they’re gonna make out more, but instead venti tells xiao to fuck him</li>
    <li>not really in a bratty way, since i either don’t think they’d be like that (at least not unironically) or the kink itself makes me uncomfortable! who is to say at the moment!</li>
    <li>it’s like a desperate, heat-of-the-moment request; not as prideful, cocky, or sure as the “<strong><em><span class="s3">bite me</span></em></strong>” had been, since he is unraveling a bit! but there is also, like, no room for interpretation when he says, clear as day, “i want you to fuck me.”</li>
    <li>another note about the blocking here is that venti will probably be kind of? straddling xiao in the finger sucking bit. like xiao is pushed back(?) and supporting his weight on one of his elbows as he distinctly has to look <em><span class="s1">up</span></em> at venti, whom’st is sucking on his fingers. (it probably adds to the horny lol.)</li>
    <li>anyway venti stops looming over him, allowing xiao to sit up more properly during the fingering, and also it would be kind of funny if venti used this position as an excuse to get handsy with xiao’s dick again. he’s here to make both mischief and love ok. it’s amusing bc he knows that xiao has the restraint not to come while venti is doing that but will still be ve very obviously responding to the touch</li>
    <li>“aww you’re blushing” → handjob kind of i guess? venti’s definitely kind of delicately tracing his fingers along the sensitive head of xiao’s dick and all; probably the same as what he’d been doing earlier but described in more explicit detail this time? </li>
    <li>and it makes xiao <em><span class="s1">feel good</span></em>!! he can feel like, the echoes of his own pulse or smth, or the echoes of venti’s touch as they pulse through him. like how when you’re nervous and someone caresses you and you <em><span class="s1">feel it</span></em> shooting through your body. having his dick touched sets xiao on edge a bit, but at the same time— he <em><span class="s1">wants this</span></em>. he <em><span class="s1">wants</span></em> to be touched and loved with his kind of grace and delicacy, and it’s like all he can do to just kind of sit there and <em><span class="s1">feel</span></em> while venti plays with him. it’s not new in that he didn’t know he could feel this way; it’s new in that for the first time, he doesn’t <em><span class="s1">reject</span></em> feeling that way for whatever reason.</li>
    <li>and so like, yeah xiao pauses for a second in how he’s fingering venti bc of ~feelings~, which has venti amused. he points it out as he kind of presses his hips back into xiao’s hand, then arches(?) forward; maybe their dicks also touch and xiao gets this kind of like. <em><span class="s1">laden</span></em> sort of dsire to have a weight sitting on his hips, having venti seatd there and grinding against him as he arches his back and fucks venti a bit in turn.</li>
    <li>and the whole time, there’s also like, this kind of pressure building in his gut. it’s like there’s a pressure point in his lower gut that’s being, well, <em><span class="s1">pressured</span></em> in the same place where all his arousal builds. like yes this DOES mean he is building towards an orgasm!! he can’t identify that as what’s coming, but venti can probably tell by the way he responds to his touch that that’s what’s coming</li>
    <li>but then venti opens his mouth and teases him about how obviously aroused xiao is (to the point where venti’s practically having to fuck himself against xiao’s fingers(?)); “do you think i can make you come?” perhaps? or smth similarly filthy, which leads into → </li>
    <li>but also xiao is a sub who is still trying to pretend he can dom or whatever, so he just like idk fingers venti harder or smth. adds another finger or something idk how this works!! either way it makes venti lose focus on what he’s doing to xiao and must instead focus on steadying himself against xiao bc wow that feels good (all according to keikaku!)</li>
    <li>blahblahblah pretty moans and staggered breathing as he rests his forehead against xiao’s shoulder → “i want you to fuck me”</li>
    <li>or like. hmm. maybe “aww you’re blushing~” → xiao gets a little embarrassed → fingers venti harder → “i want you to fuck me”</li>
    <li>this would mean that the handjob or whatever happens as the <em><span class="s1">lead-up</span></em> to “aww you’re blushing”</li>
    <li>and so then anyway at first xiao is gonna turn him onto his stomach or whatever but venti’s like “nonono. i wanna see your face.” and like ofc the suggestion makes xiao a little shy bc oh god being Perceived during that kind of intimacy!!!! he can barely handle being Perceived (end of sentence) and now???? ????? but he likes the way venti asks for it more. </li>
    <li>and also he wants to be praised soooo badly lol. he’s DOWN BAD!!!! </li>
    <li>and like, ofc venti’s cupping xiao’s cheeks in his hands as he’s lying back, asking to be fucked face-to-face, and xiao stares, kind of lost i suppose? in how pretty venti looks lying there, naked and vulnerable, full of desire and trust and ofc, <em><span class="s1">love</span></em>. and desire starts clawing at his throat like a guilty thornbush; smth smth imagery of a piercing thorn oozing blood that drips down his throat in a tiny rivulet, drips down his body like a lover’s intimate caress, and it <em><span class="s1">pools</span></em> as like. smth about the way it pools makes it beautiful, rather than frightening, like the reflection of a lake on a cold winter’s night, the gnarled and empty trees suddenly beautiful in how they carve black lines from the canvas of sky and stars.</li>
    <li>and he <em><span class="s1">drools</span></em> and he drops a hand onto venti, pins down the latter’s hip to let himself kind of get in position to put his dick in, as he nods in agreement</li>
    <li>so anyway yeah so then xiao fucks venti. and it is very sweet how closely he pays attn to venti’s every reaction, but also how keenly he can feel venti’s every tiny movement (of which there are many bc venti is rather wiggly lol).</li>
    <li>venti teases him, obviously, and still touches him all over, but he holds xiao’s face especially tenderly. strokes his cheeks <em><span class="s1">so</span></em> lovingly and xiao gets kind of embarrassed about how <em><span class="s1">delicately</span></em> venti is holding him, but then venti calls him a good boy or smth and pulls him down to make out bc they’re in love DUH</li>
    <li>and like. venti’s horny as fuck by this point, and he’s definitely acting like it. he probably has xiao touch his dick when he seems anxious about like, penetration or whatever, just so that venti starts making those pretty sounds xiao wants to hear, arches his back, and just generally signals like. “for the love of god he would like to get dicked down now”</li>
    <li>and so then xiao finally puts his dick in venti, carefully. venti is perhaps surprisingly warm, which makes sense bc ofc it’s going to be warm down there that’s where all the blood is. but anyway so ofc venti is delighted and breathless, which makes xiao’s heart beat faster</li>
    <li>and like. ofc xiao is anxious about penetrating venti and stuff, at least a little bit, though i imagine that having fingered him very thoroughly face-to-face it’s not as bad as it Could have been. but it’s kind of like, “isn’t it usually the other way around? isn’t it usually the person Getting fucked who is nervous about the whole thing, not the oe Doing the fucking?”</li>
    <li>specific anxieties… i honestly don’t think xiao is afraid of <em><span class="s1">hurting</span></em> venti so much anymore, since ofc venti will tell him and do smth if he’s not gettig fucked right, and he did well with fingering and prep after that almost-mistake. xiao’s probably just worried venti won’t like his dick or smth lmao. or honestly, xiao’s probably just afraid of crossing this kind of boundary for himself, despite how badly he wants it. bc more than he is afraid of venti not liking his dick or whatever, xiao has spent a great deal of time afraid of these very emotions within himself. and now he’s going to indulge them. what if it feels bad to indulge? he usually feels bad for indulging himself.</li>
    <li>but venti ofc pulls him out of his thoughts, pulls him close and asks to be fucked, perhaps? or maybe we could go a <em><span class="s1">pure identity</span></em> route and have venti kind of tease him like, “i can make you feel good. i <em><span class="s1">want</span></em> you; do you want me in that same way?”</li>
    <li>and so <em><span class="s1">that’s</span></em> probably what gets xiao to lean down and kiss venti as he finally fucking puts his dick into venti</li>
    <li>and so like yeah he’s in, and at first it’s just this gentle rocking as xiao, awkward but now inescapably horny kind of just does what he thinks he’s supposed to do kind of, but he’s being restrained about it and stuff bc blahblahblah anxiety, but then venti brings his legs around xiao’s waist and grinds heavily against him → friction begets friction; xiao once more ruts strongly against venti, much to the latter’s delight and pleasure → they gradually fall into a rhythm of pretty noises and building desires as xiao’s awkward self-consciousness starts to melt away and venti stops having to guide/instruct him so much and gets to just enjoy himself, and there’s a pleasantly burning pressure brewing in xiao’s gut.
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>also. kind of a nasty little side note detail to record but whatever i guess. but after xiao first, like, fully enters venti, like that kind of hips-flush-together all-the-way-in kind of thing, he pauses to just let the sensation settle over him. and also listen to his own kind of staggered breathing, study venti’s pretty, blushing face and let his gaze trail slowly down and down his partner’s body until he sees venti’s twitching dick, nd also himself, buried nside venti</li>
      <li>and a lump starts to form in the back of xiao’s throat, a mixture of arousal and God Knows What Else (guilt? disgust? fear? <em><span class="s1">pride</span></em>? Even <em><span class="s1">More</span></em> Arousal But This Time It Just Feels Dirtier For Some Reason?? who knows!!), and so draws out a little, then pushes back in, and thus begins his awkward, gentle rocking until venti gets impatient again and pulls him back down and grinds <em><span class="s1">hard</span></em> against him</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>and um. so then i guess venti comes and xiao soon after</li>
    <li>xiao does indeed get his wish about getting to hear venti calling his name with more and more desperate longing. he’s getting kinda fucked into the mattress bc he was craving hard, rough motion; yet almost despite xiao hitting it, there’s always like, this feeling of something <em><span class="s1">more</span></em> building that gets harder and harder to pin down or hold back as they go at it</li>
    <li>xiao is probably nipping at his ear; they’re both breathing hard, and venti’s squirming from overstimulation(?) until finally!! he comes ehe
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>he squirms a lot underneath xiao along the way, by the way. running his touch over xiao’s back, digging his nails in at random intervals when xiao fucks him just right, tossing his head back and forth every so often as xiao leaves lovebites along his jaw and neck, occasionally squeezing his thighs against xiao’s hips or sides or whatever, since he’s got his legs wrapped around xiao’s waist and all ♡♡♡♡♡ </li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>it’s sudden, but not unexpected for venti, who’s probably just like, “xiao, i—” and it just devolves into this low cry or smth, intercut with short breaths, as he just buries his face in the crook of xiao’s neck and holds onto him bc this is vulnerable man he wants his love as close to him as possible
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>he also tears up a little bit bc i mean yeah vulnerable and he’s also experiencing a lot of emotions at that moment, but also he’s so in love and that feeling itself is very overwhelming, and so like. yeah ofc he cries at least a little bit bc he’s happy and satisfied.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>and like. xiao <em><span class="s1">feels</span></em> the way desire builds all throughout this, and the way it <em><span class="s1">rewards</span></em> him for his obedience. he craves this kind of weight, this pressure, down by the base of his dick, between his thighs, and in thrusting in and out of venti (that is like. the crudest possible way of wording that i do not think i want to use that phrasing in the fic itself), that craving is fulfilled, briefly, and then grows with all the little signals venti gives him that <em><span class="s1">he’s enjoying this very much</span></em> hehe. </li>
    <li>so the guilt and shame recedes with the sound of venti’s voice; his own desires are building fast, and he’s not exactly sure what they are building <em><span class="s1">to</span></em> (but he’s also not thinking about that) until venti climaxes, and the combination of like. venti’s pretty voice calling his name, the deeply-rewarding pleasure of just kinda fuckin into venti so hard, and also just being held so close while venti’s in the middle of his own orgasm → xiao gets pushed over the edge as well :3</li>
    <li>i am very much pretending that there is no messy ejaculate or anythig bc that’s like. kind of gross. so basically what i’m saying here is that xiao comes inside venti so i can just pretend that it vanishes, never to be seen again. venti’s obviously, like. got his dick out. so that’s obviously something to deal with. might leave a bit of a mess. but neither of them are Looking there so it DOESN’T MATTER it is not described</li>
    <li>and that more or less concludes round one :3 </li>
    <li>→ venti sticks his fingers in xiao’s mouth and basically fantasizes aloud about railing him so hard he forgets about like literally everything he’s always angsting about like his karmic debts and whatever </li>
    <li>Also yeah. watching xiao orgasm and also getting fucked through his own orgasm Is part of the reason he’s still kind of really horny like Immediately after they go at it once.</li>
    <li>and so anyway that makes xiao horny again (like, probably embarrassingly so! like wowow you came like two minutes ago and now you wanna get your brains fucked out already? sir you are down SO BAD no one can help you now lol), but he has a hard time expressing his desire to get absolutely railed by venti out loud, so he’s mostly just reduced to awkward mumbling (probably at <em><span class="s1">least</span></em> in part bc venti <em><span class="s1">still has his fingers in xiao’s mouth</span></em> lol) bc he’s a horny loser. </li>
    <li>also they are cuddling very intimately but i think that’s just normal post-sex behavior</li>
    <li>but anyway, so then xiao sucks venti’s dick ♡♡♡</li>
    <li>n like, venti Is horny, but he’s not quite hard again. and also smth smth xiao still wants to make him feel good, and by doing the oral sex™, it gets to feel more focused on pleasuring <em><span class="s1">venti</span></em>, rather than like. xiao also getting smth out of it</li>
    <li>like xiao Does get smth out of this. like btw. it makes him happy to see venti taken care of in that way. it brings him satisfaction knowing he did that, that venti trusts him, and that he did a good job of it too. but the more mutual pleasure of penetrative anal sex still has some loose ties to guilt after he comes down from the high of orgasm. not enough to make him feel <em><span class="s1">bad</span></em>, but it makes him want to <em><span class="s1">give</span></em> to venti more. “let me take care of you again.”</li>
    <li>but anyway, so xiao gets showered with praise after he fucks venti, and also now venti wants to rail him, and xiao definitely Wants to be railed, but it’s a little embarrassing for him to just, like. Say That, so he just tells venti that he trusts venti to do anything he wants to/with him (bc he’s ~*whipped*~ lol ♡♡♡)</li>
    <li>he’s probably also like, half laying atop venti bc i mean like. he DID top just now. so it makes sense that he’s now just kind of resting atop venti, head resting on his chest and everything <strong><span class="s2">oh my god i forgot about venti’s chest tattoo</span></strong>. ummm i’ll see if i can get that in during edits but for the moment, xiao rests his head on venti’s chest, closes his eyes and listens to his partner’s heartbeat while venti hums softly and cards his fingers through xiao’s hair. </li>
    <li>venti’s half hard and xiao can feel it and is also still in the mood to fuck. but anyway, xiao says smth about how nice venti’s voice is to listen to. venti laughs and makes a joke about whether xiao is referring to his singing/humming atm or the way he said xiao’s name during sex, which just makes xiao blush and refuse to answer. </li>
    <li>venti laughs again bc he finds xiao really cute when he’s clingy, and he pats/nudges xiao’s cheek a bit and says, “you play the flute [yourself?], don’t you~♡?” bc of that one chinese euphemism for sucking dick. xiao’s like, “not as beautifully as you.” and then venti’s like, “well~ why don’t you show me anyway~♡” whilst like. idk, half-sitting up? spreading his legs?? <em><span class="s1">some</span></em> sort of physical cue for xiao to pick up on.</li>
    <li>and like. xiao does indeed pick up on his cue!!! and it’s probably less embarrassing for him Because it’s a native metaphor for him and Because it’s less direct/explicit than just being told “suck my dick” or whatever. </li>
    <li>and so then xiao sucks his dick ♡ </li>
    <li>like, xiao’s already had his mouth down there a bit earlier, but it wasn’t like, a point of particular attentive interest, and also it got cut short bc xiao tried to just stick his fingers into venti’s butthole without warning which was Not Fun</li>
    <li>so anyway!! this is where xiao gets to pay particular attention to venti’s fun and flirty upper thigh tattoo hehe. like. chomp!! kisskiss chomp!!!! bc venti likes xiao’s teeth a Lot and for various factors (just got fucked really hard, inner upper thighs being an erogenous zone in general, teef Sharp), it’s a Very Sensitive area that brings venti a lot of pleasure</li>
    <li>and like, venti has his hands carding through xiao’s hair as he goes to town down there bc where ELSE would venti be putting his hands?? the SHEETS??? <strong><span class="s2">NO </span></strong>bc venti is touchy-touchy and squirmy-squirmy; those hands are <em><span class="s1">not</span></em> staying in any one place for long unless he can lovingly play with/curl his fingers into his partner’s hair</li>
    <li>but anyway, i’m honestly not that sure if it’ll be like, Actually sucking dick since i just generally don’t like the language that gets used there, or like. the imagery maybe? but whatever happens, xiao is very mouthy down there</li>
    <li>his hands, too— both before and during the oral sex— are also very much all over venti’s inner thighs, like waaaaay high up (though he probably still drags his nails lightly over the tattoo area Specifically) bc obviously whatever lovebites he’s left there by now have started to get quite tender~ ♡ </li>
    <li>venti enjoys himself a lot :3</li>
    <li>also if venti comes here, xiao is swallowing that without question. like yeah i read it’s rude to come in your partner’s mouth without discussing it before hand but this is a fantasy i don’t have to justify anything. he’s swallowing.</li>
    <li>kind of still on the fence as to whether or not venti gets to come from xiao doing the oral sex thing, but i do like the idea of him getting to have this. so he will probably get to have this!</li>
    <li>either way, the oral sex bit ends with venti taking xiao’s face by the chin and tilts it up to look at him and venti is just like, “<em><span class="s1">i looooooove youuuuu~~~</span></em>” (said with like a million billion hearts in his voice) and like yeah he also says it like a million times while they fuck but smth about venti’s expression <strong><span class="s2">&#38;&#38;</span></strong> being unable to look away <strong><em><span class="s4">&#38;&#38;</span></em></strong> knowing he’s being Good At Obedience obviously drives xiao nuts (not as a double entendre) and he ends up staring at venti (almost drooling a bit, then swallowing it back when he notices (which is also like him being polite about being clean about ejaculate assuming venti came in his mouth)) until venti like, either pulls xiao up to be face-to-face with him or slides down to be on xiao’s same level (i kind of like the latter more symbolically, but that means i’ll have to think about the blocking and positioning more for the oral sex bit)</li>
    <li>like. okay. so xiao is on his knees, maybe from the side of the bed or wherever they’re fucking in order to suck venti’s dick or whatever (and also that one oscar wilde(?) quote that’s like “love is a sacrament best taken kneeling” ehe). venti finishes, xiao swallows the emissions, and then probably starts kissing venti again huh. like starting right below the navel and working his way up this time?</li>
    <li>hmmm that doesn’t feel quite right. maybe venti tilts xiao’s head up before he comes and gets xiao blushing like that → fingers in his mouth, fantasizing about railing him, though i still have a hard time connecting the head tilting to the fingers in his mouth.</li>
    <li>i’ll figure that out later what matters rn is that xiao is flustered and too embarrassed to say “yes i wanna get railed” out loud to venti so instead he says “i trust you to do whatever you want to me.”</li>
    <li>okay but before i forget the details of venti sticking his fingers in xiao’s mouth, xiao also finds himself sucking on venti’s fingers as they play idly with his tongue. esp since xiao was like Just sucking dick (and has a habit of biting and being rather mouthy in general) i think it Makes Sense that he’d instinctively start obediently sucking at venti’s fingers when they poke between his lips. </li>
    <li>but also, maybe xiao’s mouth is just open (probably still has some visible traces of semen left in it too), and he’s drooling, as venti just kind of explores the space with all the pretty, sharp teef with his long, delicate fingers :3 and he fingers xiao’s tongue or smth in a way that gets xiao’s breathing hot and heavy ehe ♡ </li>
    <li>**[venti, delighted with xiao’s reply, takes his fingers out of xiao’s mouth and leans in for an absolutely <em><span class="s1">filthy</span></em>, eager kiss</li>
    <li>ummm blocking here,,, venti was probably lying on his back when he had his fingers in xiao’s mouth, while xiao was on his hands and knees above him. venti then sits up (meaning that xiao also has to kind of sit up), takes his fingers out of xiao’s mouth, and leans in for a kiss, meaning they’re both kinda sitting as they make out. </li>
    <li>but i also want venti to stick those fingers xiao was sucking on moments before into xiao’s butt here bc he’s excited to have a chance to fuck xiao in turn, so ofc he’s gonna get started as soon as he can. and to do that it’s probably more practical to not really have any ambiguity as to whether his hole is exposed enough for venti to easily stick his fingers into it.</li>
    <li>or maybe even after venti more or less sits up, xiao’s still on his knees in some way. i don’t know i kind of wish i had anatomy dolls here so i could figure this shit out more</li>
    <li>soooo i guess venti pulls xiao down to make out, which at the very least gives him easy access to xiao’s hole. </li>
    <li>and so yeah now it’s xiao’s turn to be anally fingered :)</li>
    <li>he’s not Terribly familiar with having things there, but he definitely doesn’t Hate it!!! it feels a little weird, but he is into it bc it’s venti and he <em><span class="s1">trusts</span></em> venti and <em><span class="s1">loves</span></em> him sooo much and also venti is gentle and tells him he’s doing well </li>
    <li>but also xiao is a Lot shier than venti and so after venti pokes at his prostate or smth, he has lke this sharp little inhale that has venti pause? “does that feel good?” → xiao, blushing like mad, looks pointedly away as he gives a tiny nods, which basically has venti decide that it’s just time for him to get out from underneath xiao</li>
    <li>xiao’s like, pretty close to being ready to get totally fucked anyway</li>
    <li>like, venti probably takes his fingers out of xiao’s butt and gives him a kissu as he sits up (or many kissies. for funs o3o), then coaxes him onto his hands and knees, showering xiao with kisses and lovebites to the point of embarrassment and then casually gets back to fingering him</li>
    <li>or maybe he’ll eat ass! but i tend to think that’s a little weird and gross</li>
    <li>also if it just goes back to fingering then venti can also admire xiao’s back and also peper him with kisses at random, just to keep him on his toes</li>
    <li>anyway, it’s really not that long before xiao starts making kind of <em><span class="s1">needy</span></em> noises lol, and at first venti pretends not to notice, but then xiao’s breathing starts to stagger, and he rocks his hips a little against venti’s hands after otherwise being quite good at remaining mostly still </li>
    <li>“mostly” bc he Did still physically respond; he was just much more Restrained about it, whereas this hits the point where it’s getting to be kind of much!</li>
    <li>esp in combination with venti touching his back → phantom limb wings feeling like they need to be stretched, but they do not exist, so he arches his back and that kind of just results in his composure starting to crack</li>
    <li>anyway~~~ it’s also been <em><span class="s1">well</span></em>-established by this point that venti is by far the more teasing partner and will probably frustrate xiao a little bc well!! xiao <em><span class="s1">did</span></em> say he trusted venti with anything!!!!</li>
    <li>but while xiao has <em><span class="s1">restraint</span></em>, he does <strong><span class="s2">not</span></strong> have <em><span class="s1">patience</span></em>, so at some point, venti’s gonna be still just touching him without properly fucking him bc ofc venti’s waiting for a more Direct signal from xiao</li>
    <li>but anyway, so xiao starts physically responding more to venti’s touch, but it’s not until he basically makes the verbal equivalent of going like “<strong><em><span class="s3">♡♡♡♡♡♡♡</span></em></strong>” that venti <em><span class="s1">finally</span></em> says smth along the lines of like, “oh, are you ready? ♡” and puts his <em><span class="s1">free</span></em> <em><span class="s1">hand</span></em> to xiao’s <em><span class="s1">neck</span></em> to take his pulse</li>
    <li>(but also xiao <strong><span class="s2">feels</span></strong> that faint, faint pressure against his windpipe and it turns him on more)</li>
    <li>and xiao shivers lightly, but still nods</li>
    <li>so then anyway venti puts his dick inside xiao and it’s nice. it’s like the ultimate exercise of trust for xiao, and he’s frankly a little embarrassed by how soothing it kind of is. perhaps “cathartic” is a better word than “soothing” here, though.</li>
    <li>and like this should ofc go without saying, but venti praises him effusively the whole time he’s pressing his dick into xiao, then as he’s giving xiao the moment to kind of adjust, proceeds to touch and kiss him all around his upper back, which really just has xiao instinctively grinding back onto venti, hot and bothered by all the tiny movements, bc again!!! like i said, he has <strong><span class="s2">restraint</span></strong>, but not <em><span class="s1">patience</span></em></li>
    <li>venti puts a hand at xiao’s waist to kind of hold him still, teases him for being impatient whilst also praising him for being so eager (would be funny to make this rhyme)</li>
    <li>but ofc he starts grinding against xiao anyway, though he’s much slower and more deliberate about it than xiao had been with him earlier, wild and rather restless, and his hand snakes down btwn xiao’s legs to touch his dick again hehe]** </li>
    <li>**[admittedly unsure whether gonna keep this part but it’s Fine!! maybe i’ll see if it can be integrated with the like Second possibility outilnes right after this ]**</li>
    <li>CHANGED MY MIND a little about xiao’s reply to venti wanting to rail him; rather than admitting outright Right Then that he trusts venti, he says smth more along the lines of like, “do whatever you wish [with? to?] me” or like “i’m fine with anything you want” or maybe even “i’ll follow you anywhere the wind blows” bc that’s romantic hehe</li>
    <li>which like. we can still have venti pull xiao down for an absolutely fucking <em><span class="s1">filthy</span></em> kiss i think. as a treat. we can probably ignore the rest of what’s in the [**] tho</li>
    <li>instead, after kissing xiao breathless, venti rolls them both over such that he’s straddling xiao, pinning him down by the shoulders(?), and next thing xiao knows, venti’s waaaay up in his face and leaning in even more teasingly close to ask, “so then it’s okay if [i fuck you] like this~?”</li>
    <li>n xiao blushes, practically on instinct, and ends up freezing— bc he knows better than to give in to his first instinct/reflex to fight, and he doesn’t hate it enough for flight, to teleport from venti’s arms and land across the room — staring at every detail of venti’s mischevous face, every damp baby hair and stray eyelash clinging to his face, and justin general becoming more and more <em><span class="s1">painfully</span></em> aware of all the ways he is vulnerable from this osition</li>
    <li>combined with the fact that venti would be, like, <strong><em><span class="s3">watching</span></em></strong> him (his <em><span class="s1">face</span></em>!!) with the same careful attn xiao himself paid to venti when <em><span class="s1">he</span></em> topped… </li>
    <li>he is NOT ready for that lol, so he turns onto his stomach with a curt and simple, “no.”</li>
    <li>venti laughs, since it’s not like he expected xiao to agree anyway; he was just teasing bc <em><span class="s1">really</span></em>, xiao, you <em><span class="s1">cannot</span></em> be speaking like you’re willig all your agency away to someone else like that!! </li>
    <li>venti then affectionately traces (pokes?) a chain of little hearts down xiao’s lower back, maybe comments on the fact that it’s so much easier for xiao to deny things when he’s the beneficiary, and so much <em><span class="s1">harder</span></em> for him to deny those same things when he’s beneficent. </li>
    <li>venti starts poking at xiao’s hole, lightly kissing him btwn his shoulder blades and mumbling sweet nothings, asking xiao to get on his knees at least</li>
    <li>n xiao complies , though he’s also thinking a lot about <em><span class="s1">why</span></em> he worded his consent in the way he did in the first place, as in the sort of way that sounds like he’s relinquishing his autonomy to venti</li>
    <li>like, granted. this already difficult task (articulating his <em><span class="s1">feelings</span></em>!!!!!!!!!) is made a <strong><span class="s2">Lot</span></strong> harder to concentrate on bc venti. is Touching Him. (and he likes it hehe)</li>
    <li>anyway, the answer is very obviously “bc xiao’s trust is founded on the belief that venti <em><span class="s1">loves</span></em> him, and that this is a selfless love that genuinely, deeply desires to be <em><span class="s1">good</span></em> to xiao, to make <em><span class="s1">him</span></em> happy; to share in these carnal pleasures together, rather than simply <em><span class="s1">use</span></em> xiao as a means to his own (climax) end.”</li>
    <li>…probably all that manages to come out is just “…i trust you.” lol. i love u xiao ur so repressed ♡ </li>
    <li>anyway, obvs the “i trust you” Gets to venti lol so he rewards xiao w/more gentle touches and butterfly kisses, and then he starts asking xiao questions to try to pin down <em><span class="s1">why</span></em>, exactly, xiao trusts him so intimately</li>
    <li>so like. yes i’m saying that venti more or less fucks the articulated answer out of xiao. i guess they’re having character development in their sex now. -w-</li>
    <li>it’s probably similar to that one comic i once translated where i didn’t realize they were fucking lol and venti says smth along the lines of, “you’re becoming more human, xiao… is it bc of my desire for you? both gods and humans have their desires, but i want to share something special with you…”</li>
    <li>like, if not in the language/questions, then at LEAST in the vibes bc that was a really tastefully done comic. rokuyo221 i miss you</li>
    <li>ANYWAY vx part will probably be paced more slowly than the xv half, though it might still be shorter than the xv part bc that first half also got the stripping and the foreplay, meaning that it took xiao literally 3,800 words to put his dick in.</li>
    <li>but really i just think it’s fun if when bottoming, venti wants to get fucked kinda rough (definitely at least in part bc xiao’s inexperience makes him very careful, which i hear can be really annoying when desperately horny and wanting to be touched with some level of concrete <em><span class="s1">force</span></em>, bc that’s satisfying, that’s cathartic), and then just does everything with just agonizing deliberation, slow and teasing, and a little torturous for xiao specifically, albeit in a good way, bc he’s not used to these indulgences; indulging himself is supposed to feel bad but this doesn’t feel bad it feels really nice actually hehehe</li>
    <li>and like. obviously xiao struggles a lot with articulating his desires out loud or as requests, but that’s also kind of why venti ends up kind of fucking it out of him, bc with every little snippet of truth that manages to get articulated, venti rewards him with pretty, loving touches and um. sensual fucking. ehe.</li>
    <li>have been told that there’s nothing really all that interesting about having a dick up one’s ass unless it’s moving around. have also been told it can be kind of a comfy position to be in after orgasming as well. not really sure where this note is going, aside from like being here for reference. </li>
    <li>maybe the bit where venti gets xiao to articulate <em><span class="s1">why</span></em> exactly xiao trusts him so much is just the foreplay lol. is that a thing that happens when going a second time in one night/session? who knows!! but it’d be fun to have it happen here</li>
    <li>anyway, in that case i think we can more or less just return to the [**] part of the outline when xiao actually has a dick inside him</li>
    <li>but it is IMPORTANT TO NOTE. bc it seems i forgot to include this part of it in my notes, which is like a crime from how ingrained this part of the fantasy is to me. is that venti touches xiao’s back, in particular his upper back, like btwn his shoulderblades kind of thing, where his wings had been rooted long ago, <em><span class="s1">a lot</span></em>. touch kiss lick whatever there’s a lot of odd sensations going on there
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>in particular, i imagine there’s actually a lot of nerve damage down the majority of his back, similar to joy. so, every time venti isn’t actively moving his touch over xiao’s back, xiao can’t tell if he’s actually being touched there or not. there’s mostly impressions of pressure, and faint, dim sensations of heat, but it’s difficult for him to parse plain touch, so letting venti run his hands, to linger over the scars on his back… it’s an intimacy he’s never granted to anyone before this moment with venti, usually teleporting out of range the instant someone lays a finger to his back.</li>
      <li>and also yes he craves to stretch his phantom limb wings. he wants to be touched there, preened and cuddled closely</li>
      <li>n like obviously there are no limbs there to be preened and stroked, but venti does teethe a bit at the nape of xiao’s neck, then nuzzles his face against his partner v. affectionately,,,</li>
    </ul></li>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>anyway. you know what would also be funny? if venti also went, “i’ve heard stories that say you will come when called… is that true, o pretty guardian? is it true that the last yaksha will <em><span class="s1">come</span></em> if i call out his name?”
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>xiao, whom’st had never previously considered the dirty way that line could’ve been interpreted: *realizes he is In Danger lol*</li>
    <li>xiao says smth along the lines of like, “i will, if it is you who calls my name” maybe. that might be too bold, but i think that he’s also allowed to be a bit more forward since he managed to articulate how deeply he trusts venti by this point so!!</li>
    <li>venti. obviously wants to test this now. :)
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>something also to note here is that although i don’t think it would be that good practice for xiao to mix up his <em><span class="s1">name</span></em> with his <em><span class="s1">titles</span></em> during sex— at least not in such a way that links them together so explicitly— it’s important to note that when venti mentions having heard of a legend wherein the last guardian yaksha will come when called, it Feels, in a way, that the presence of the double entendre somehow also maintains a separation btwn xiao’s duty (guardian of liyue whom’st will Literally show up at your side when you call his name) and his desires (as himself, xiao, whom’st will. orgasm when venti tells him to lol)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>OTHER THING TO NOTE here is that venti brings it up when xiao is starting to get close to climaxing, though since i’ve read that prostate/anal orgasms are different from like. penetrative orgasms (former being a much slower build, as well as feeling its effects all throughout one’s body vs. just centralized in one’s dick lol), haven’t yet decided whether xiao himself can identify That’s What’s Coming. but venti knows his cues and tells (somehow) and so distracts him :)
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>and also venti calls him a good boy when he says he can do that, which tbh is probably why he doesn’t let himself come until venti says his whole name, bc if he holds out like that, if he’s just a little bit patient, then venti will praise him again, and xiao wants <em><span class="s1">sooooo</span></em> badly to be good lol</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>right and so then venti, with one hand stroking xiao’s dick and the other braced lightly, <em><span class="s1">lightly</span></em> at the base of xiao’s throat, and also grinding into xiao’s ass, leans in <em><span class="s1">reaaaaal</span></em> close, until he’s panting hotly into xiao’s ear, starts deliberately making <em><span class="s1">the most </span></em><strong><em><span class="s3">salacious</span></em></strong><em><span class="s1"> sounds</span></em>, sometimes mixed in with the start or just a part of xiao’s name, just to keep him on edge, but Notably, xiao’s still not, like, allowed (by himself? by venti? dunno!) to come until venti <em><span class="s1">says</span></em> his <em><span class="s1">entire name</span></em>. does this mean that xiao has a voice kink, or is this something else. <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>i really don’t know. but anyway ♡ 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>truthfully, i don’t think that venti would torment xiao like that for very long, but assuming xiao’s been on his <em><span class="s1">hands</span></em> and knees this entire time, i think it would be fun if his elbows gave out and he ends up resting on his forearms at around this point c:</li>
    <li>venti pauses briefly when that happens, asks if xiao’s okay; xiao just nods, already craving venti’s motion inside him again, and so they return to business lol</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>anyway, at some point venti’s salacious noises go from teasing and a little over-the-top to actually genuinely kind of needy; mostly noticeable by the way the hand at the base of xiao’s throat either increases in its slight pressure, or starts creeping up his neck
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>ALTHOUGH actually maybe that hand can just start at xiao’s chest, right around where his heartbeat pounds away at his chest (blahblahblah romanticism of the ribcage and the desires held with in it and the heart and the feeling of all that trying to escape, fly freely and blahblahblah etc etc), and then make its way upwards until it’s near the base of xiao’s neck (which makes xiao more aware of his <em><span class="s1">breathing</span></em>, and the way he swallows and all that stuff) hehehehe</li>
    <li>but anyway venti’s climax is like, decidedly un-teasing, as he kind of buries his face into the crook of xiao’s neck (or the back of his neck, or smth; definitely imagining xiao feeling his hair shifting around as venti like, y’know, nuzzles strongly against him), and moans xiao’s name, very prettily, very breathlessly, very laden with <em><span class="s1">desire</span></em> and satisfaction (and also hope!! bc he <em><span class="s1">wants, above all, to make xiao feel good, too!!!!!</span></em> and he hopes that he’s accomplished that), which has xiao finally let go of his Insane Amounts of Self-Restraint <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>and frankly has his vision white out for a moment ♡ </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>and then they both <em><span class="s1">flop over</span></em> onto their sides, still a tangled mess of limbs (and venti’s dick still kind of in xiao tbh), as venti cuddles up against xiao from behind, both breathing hard as they come down from their highs hehe,,,
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>and then venti starts wriggling again, this time to crawl over xiao just enough that they can kiss again, sweetly, lovingly (very lovingly) for a while</li>
    <li>and xiao rolls over a bit such that he can reciprocate better, and they just make out for a while again, bc xiao missed that when getting fucked from behind y’know. he needs to tell venti that he’s very happy with what happened to him <em><span class="s1">somehow</span></em> and all!!!</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>and then, finally, they part for air a bit, and xiao has a hand on venti’s cheek, gently stroking it and watching his love ever so tenderly,,, and venti shuts his eyes and kisses xiao briefly on the lips one last time, then reaches out to either pat his cheek or brush some damp bangs out of his eyes, and says smth along the lines of, “okay, let’s go clean up now, [[my?] love(?)]”
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>AND ALSO xiao <em><span class="s1">finally</span></em> manages to say “i love you” out loud at this very end :3</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>THE END</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">okay smth-smth wings as a metaphor for humanity and the desires thereof. xiao as a creature who had his wings ripped out from a young age, who during sex feels the scars and long-ago phantom presence of said wings most keenly, conceptualizes the guilt he feels around desiring sex and sexual intimacy as bleeding from those wing scars.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">wings as a symbol of freedom, venti as a (divine!!) being who </span><em><span class="s6">has</span></em><span class="s5"> wings of his own but chooses to hide them to pass as human, who chooses to show them during sex as an extension of how he expresses himself and his desires. how the wings can be both A Thing (the inherent eroticisms of wing grooming, after all) and just another part of venti at the same time. they can be used as both a form of expression and disguise (sheltering/hiding underneath the weave of one’s wings, if they’re large enough, for example)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s5">the trust inherent to xiao letting venti touch his scars at all; the complicated mixed feelings he must have around granting someone access to a part of himself so intimate, so associated with violence, with all these </span><em><span class="s6">desires</span></em><span class="s5"> he is </span><em><span class="s6">not supposed to </span></em><strong><em><span class="s7">have</span></em></strong><span class="s5">. that’s like, basically sex to him. tbh. perhaps even more intimate and vulnerable to him than actual sex lmao</span></p>
