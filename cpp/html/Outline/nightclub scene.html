  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>the kyoto kids are the reason we end up with the nightclub scene, probably</li>
    <li>toudou meets yuuji at some point when he goes off on his own (as he does), they become friends, and toudou tells the kyoto kids abt him and they’re like “wtf who is he” and toudou’s like “idk but i sense that he is of great importance” “wow thanks a lot toudou”</li>
    <li>hanami might be nightclub scene, actually. like i’m still not sure why they’re in a nightclub or anything. but like idk toudou and yuuji are going up against hanami, and then hanami taints toudou’s heart shard, and so they THINK they’ve defeated hanami, but then sukuna tells yuuji that the heart’s been tainted and it keeps them from returning the shard
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>or okay hanami is not nightclub scene; hanami is smth else, since after all that, i think it would be a good opportunity for miwa to sneak out and return her shard of embarrassment now that they know they run the risk of getting possessed otherwise. she explains to them why the kyoto kids are behaving the way they do, and then leaves before they notice her missing</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>anyway megumi embarrassment crisis at that point, and we still have room for the nightclub scene to lock maki and mai in a closet together</li>
    <li>nobara probably first starts using her hammer to fight during the nightclub scene</li>
  </ul></li>
