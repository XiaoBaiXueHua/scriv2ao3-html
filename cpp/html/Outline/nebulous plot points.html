<ul class="ul1">
  <li>stars/constellations shine when their emotions run high/they’re happy
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>when stars lose their shine, they become susceptible to corruption, and the fallen constellations (curses) can swoop in and corrupt their hearts and the shard they are protecting, which is what happens to rika</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>mahito takes advantage of the memory loss associated with falling to manipulate junpei</li>
  <li>rika has been a fragile person all her life, probably reliant on yuuta (her LOVE), so she was already very vulnerable from the start on earth. without yuuta, she’s easily transformed/corrupted by a curse, so we end up getting an arc abt her and yuuta where yuuta has to reverse the damage to her and maybe also the heart shard she has?
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>like yuuta canonically has healing powers so i think he should also be able to reverse the corruption like shoko</li>
      <li>getou can remove the corruption from the shards not through reversed technique, but by literally drawing it out and eating it like with curses and his cursed technique. shoko n yuuta doing it through reverse technique means that they bring the curse back to life, but they win through an epic battle ofc</li>
    </ul></li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>anyway, yuuta and rika are a reverse parallel to the orion and scorpio myth, where instead of scorpio killing orion and continuing the eternal chase in the sky, scorpio saves orion
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>like i think it would be super bomb if the main reason rika (orion) was so weak and sickly was because that’s the most common myth about orion, since it explains why we have orion and scorpio on opposite ends of the night sky, and so the power of story and song bitches it affects her health as someone host to the constellation orion’s spirit</li>
      <li>and like everyone else believes it too!! and yuuta feels kind of bad for it, since it was the spirit passed unto him that’s cursing his love, but the two of them also accept that there’s nothing they can really do abt it, so he just does his best to take care of her until they get separated on earth </li>
      <li>the secret here is that when yuuta tells like yuuji and the gang abt himself and rika (like they’ve probably met her by this point, but don’t know who she is or why she’s important bc she’s unrecognizable), the gang is like “well… what if you were the one to save her wholeheartedly? what if that broke the curse of orion?” and slowly, yuuta stops believing in the doomed lovers bit, and it saves her when they like. save her lol
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>like when they were actually in the sky growing up and stuff, they had this lowkey star-crossed childhood lovers thing going on, where everyone believed that yuuta had poisoned her by accepting her love or w/e, but inside, they wished it weren’t true (while also believing it to be true), and that wish is what KEPT rika alive and from losing her shine in the sky, and once she’s safe on earth, yuuta takes her back to the sky to give her the chance to recover, but he might return for other things later in the narrative, since they’re getting close to returning to the sky at that point</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>so the curses wanna corrupt the heart shards in order to gain control over megumi when they’re returned, but sukuna knows that this will weaken his own hold on megumi when yuuji finally returns his heart shard, and he tells yuuji they need to purify the shards before returning them, though the way yuuji thinks about it makes it sound like his idea
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>the way it’s presented in the narrative makes it seem like there’s room for suspicion on that fact, but no one questions it in-universe or in the a/ns</li>
    </ul></li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>so yeah then the kids know they need to purify them before returning the shards, which leads them to meeting getou</li>
    <li>if they hadn’t tho sukuna would have been massively weakened when his possessed shard was returned to megumi and so they really made a bunch of stuff worse lol</li>
    <li>they don’t purify any shards until they actually first encounter a corrupted one bc they literally just don’t realize corruption is an option; they literally just lucked out on all the prior ones lol</li>
    <li>they don’t purify yuuji’s either bc it’s been on his person the entire time so there hasn’t BEEN an opportunity for curses to do anything to it
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>or at least that’s what they think :)</li>
      <li>bc they didn’t realize there was time btwn megumi falling and yuuji finding him :)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>the curses are basically eliminated one by one. they infuse themselves w/the heart shard to gain power, but then when the kids eliminate their physical bodies, they get destroyed in the purification process</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>miminana seek out getou, and part of how getou gains the mc’s trust is bc miminana’s heart shards are already safe, and they’re w/him, helping him out on his earth apothecary booth or w/e. it lets megumi push down his distrust that he doesn’t understand enough to let getou do his thing
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>nd like getou is LITERALLY doing the right thing here. megumi just doesn’t have the memory of who shattered his heart yet, or the context behind why the heart was even shattered in the first place to know all that</li>
    <li>getou probably also doesn’t realize sukuna is a factor in all this, doesn’t even realize he’s really out there. the curses don’t tell him either, since they probably still don’t fully trust him</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>the reason getou doesn’t just kill the curses as he finds them is bc they’re too powerful for him in their default forms. he’s weakened from like, all the sky stuff, since they probably got him good as he was fleeing, and he’s all alone on earth. plus, if he slips up w/the curses, he’ll have both sky and curse bounties on his head, and that’s a pretty tight position to be in when literally all he wants to do is get out of this fuckin mess, so he allies with them for survival and as a long term thread of a plan to get rid of them once and for all
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>gojou sees this, which is why he dawdles so much on earth</li>
    <li>he probably also guides the kids to saori once he finds them, even telling saori about her ability to grant wishes as a fallen star</li>
    <li>he’s playing at persecuting getou, but he doesn’t ACTUALLY know where the gay toe is on earth, so he leaves the curses alive after deducing getou’s survival strategy, then guides the kids 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>wait what if it’s during the okkorika arc at the very end when they get the heart shard rika was protecting that megumi finally remembers that getou was the one who shattered his heart? and then when they finally return to that conversation a few chapters later, yuuta reveals that he has reverse technique and purifies rika’s shard, they defeat the curse, etc etc?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>anyway, the kids find getou before gojou does, so when they mention it to him, he’s like “oh? interesting.” “what?” “just he’s my one and only” and the kids immediately turn suspicions on gojou bc REMEMBER we don’t get introduced to gojou until AFTER the “getou shattered my heart” reveal in the sun. </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>anyway, after they meet gojou, they still need heart shards purified later, and yuuta is busy being up in the sky, so gojou fetches shouko from the sky to do the purification instead</li>
  <li>could i project **dy onto… <em><span class="s1">maki</span></em>??? like, 3/3/2019: 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>“**dy <em><span class="s1">hates</span></em> the messiness that is feelings. he told me whilst playing chess: he likes quick victories. to him, this is more of a business-like exchange than anything else; it’s something to be gotten over with. </li>
    <li>“now this is BAD because now he’s just straight-up ignoring <em><span class="s1">all</span></em> feelings. that’s callous as shit, man. </li>
    <li>“feelings ARE messy!! they’re COMPLICATED! DELICATE! <em><span class="s1">N U A N C E D !!!</span></em></li>
    <li>“he doesn’t want to deal with the messiness that is <em><span class="s1">feelings</span></em>. but, by extension, he hasn’t really been able to consider what happens when you deal with a messy, sensitive, <em><span class="s1">feelings</span></em>-y person like beta. he’s never had to take a look at any of the aftermath he may have caused because he wants to treat it like it’s neat and clean and <strong><em><span class="s2">business</span></em></strong>. </li>
    <li>“he can’t do that. he has to learn how to <em><span class="s1">have</span></em> (and accept and process and respond to) emotion!! no more locking it all within!!! bottling feelings up is bad!!!”
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>like, either maki or nobara. nobara so far has been portrayed as having feelings for sure, but in this very simplistic, childish and selfish way. maki viewing emotions like business might also work for her, since she’s very career-driven, and falling in love w/nobara creeps up on her like that. i think that as nobara learns to treat emotions with more nuance, as they both learn to be more open and vulnerable with their own feelings, nobara can also teach maki that it’s okay to treat emotions as something personal to you, too. hmm.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>when getou was losing it and teetering on the edge after riko falls to earth (and presumably dies to them), instead of directly massacring a hundred people, he instead refuses to let the sun rise for like, a month or smth idk. the sun doesn’t shine for quite a long time, which probably definitely kills a bunch of people on earth tbh, and he’s about to just straight up destroy all life on earth when gojou has his outburst of “i care. on purpose on purpose on purpose i’m gonna care about you and everyone and our actions and how they affect people” kind of thing and pulls him back from the brink.</li>
  <li>master tengen/sky king is represented by the north star, for it is all the night sky that revolves around him, like confucius 2.1 “to be excellent in administration is to be like the north star. as it remains in one position, all the other stars surround it.”</li>
  <li><br /></li>
</ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p class="p2"><br /></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>once upon a time, the sky had only the sun and the moon</li>
  <li>people passed into legends passed into the sky as the stars and constellations</li>
  <li>master tengen defeated sukuna originally in the sky, thus creating the first fallen/forgotten constellation when sukuna tried to rise up and take over with power or w/e steal all the magic in the sky it’s all very fwoo fwoo rn
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>anyway, in exchange for defeating sukuna, master tengen was granted immortal life but no immortal youth, and once every generation he had to pick out a single child of exceptional magical potential to become his new vessel like in canon</li>
    <li>defeating sukuna and casting him down to earth means that he gets forgotten, which is why saori glosses over how the sky king tengen gets his immortality: she was born far too late to know anything other than the sanitized version of history</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>so then one year, a girl named amanai riko was born in the sky, and she was destined to become the next star plasma vessel
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>gojou and getou, the sun and moon themselves, <strong><span class="s3">[notes cut out here]</span></strong></li>
  </ul></li>
<p class="p3"><br /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Momo + mai friendship, so momo doesn't give back disgust until mai has reconciled w/maki n returned envy.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Miwa's character arc might be around going from &#34;haha yeah I'm useless&#34; to &#34;actually I can do things and I'm not just someone you can put down&#34;. I REALLY don't want her character arc climax in &#34;save mechamaru&#34; tho. Hmm.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Kamo is the last kyoto kid to return his shard. &#34;hope, man. You gotta hold onto it. It's the last thing you got.&#34;  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Hope might be also what allows yuuji to let himself give over the shard of love to megumi, since he sees megumi hoping so hard for a better future. Hehehe.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Kamo might also be an interesting character to explore, since he was probably not expected to be anything when he was born, but ended up the constellation of virgo. He n megumi have parallels in canon, and I might like to bring that out here, too, with the way they're expected to become their clan heads. He probably holds out the longest bc he wants to see if he really respects megumi first.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Toudou becoming friends w/yuuji begins the bridge btwn kyoto n tokyo kids in this au, so maybe miwa isn't the first to return her shard after all. Or maybe miwa just crosses over n doesn't build a bridge the way toudou does, since she'll be occupied w/other things, like getting home.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Ohhh imagine nobara loses signal or phone battery at some point and loses contact w/fumi for an extended period of time, which worries her a bit at first, but ultimately way less than she thought it would, and when she can finally text fumi again, it feels like there's less holding them together, esp since on fumi's end, she worried less abt nobara than she would have expected too.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Maki n mai's twin spirit severance (transfer of gemini wholly to mai) doesn't happen until after megumi is overtaken by sukuna, which allows mai to return to the sky while maki stays behind w/nobara n yuuji n finds saori/riko.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">I'm also not sure what would drive the severance in this case, too. In canon, it's bc mai gives up her life for maki (taking all the cursed energy and no longer holding her down). In fruits basket, it's having bond that's stronger than the one w/akito.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Here, maki still wants to create a place for mai to be happy, and she wants to do this by becoming sky king. Not queen I think she'd rather be king. She has no plans to sever the connection btwn her and mai, but I guess mai knows that the sky recognizes the both of them (similarly to canon) and takes the full responsibility of gemini unto herself so that she doesn't hold maki back. I feel like constellations should have particular responsibilities but I am always drawing a blank here ugh.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Honestly that could work in my favor if I ever wanted to do a (SHORTER) sequel </span><em><span class="s5">azimuth</span></em><span class="s4">, which would resolve nobara's family situation n stuff as well as overthrow the sky government n have kenjaku doing shit that re-involves yuuji/gives him more history/depth bc they'd have to go back to earth probably, and part of that sky government reform could be realizing the zodiac doesn't really do anything, and they're just uselessly bound to the sky king, and now we follow much more fruits basket plot where we free </span><em><span class="s5">them</span></em><span class="s4"> as we do all the other stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Mai n tsumiki might end up being good friends in this au, since the twins were technically assigned to megumi, who made one of them (probably mai) protect his sister tsumiki. Mai probably preferred to go bc that was an easier job than protecting megumi lol.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">I feel like this planning is also building up to tsumiki being in some way connected to getou. Not as closely as miminana, although I guess that'd make her friends w/miminana too which would be fun, but I think her investment in megumi would probably make her dig most into getou, esp since she probably also has the time for it compared to the more established sky adults. She probably leads that investigation, and okay so maybe she's not connected w/getou too much before the heart shattering, but megumi connects her to his story in that way.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In the zodiac trials that narrow in on their focus on yuuji, everyone else is investigating the sky court n stuff, learning more abt the higher-ups that would have caused getou to snap (since that'd take a lot, and maybe we should just get the bit that leads into his shattering of megu's heart be like 'fuck the system' as a way of glossing over his deeper motives n reasons n how bad it really is). Megumi is pretty much just a damsel at this point.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The zodiac trials are pretty much just the name of these twelve gates yuuji has to pass through to get to megumi before the merger n stuff I guess, bc after they got him back they had to wait for a new auspicious day (winter solstice eyyy) n now they have to have him under lock and key to &#34;&#34;keep him safe&#34;&#34;. The current zodiac holders probably had nothing to do with their actual creation; it's probably some ancient thing, and so yuuji has to work with each of them to figure out how to dismantle it.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">What the hell is nobara doing, then? Her character arc is learning the balance btwn selfishness n selflessness as she moves on from her past and reaches for a future. She goes into the sky because that's something she wants to do, follow maki, and also help out with the situation because she knows she can be of use (having &#34;&#34;&#34;gotten over&#34;&#34;&#34; her past trauma from high school n stuf). Once there, she probably helps yuuji in executing the methods through the gates themselves, since the constellations themselves probably aren't allowed through just bc, and also she's friends w/megumi too c'mon. but smth she can do no one else could provide? To an extent, leaving for the sky is also her letting go of her earthly connections, which had tied her down to the past as well, but once there…? Fuck, man. Maybe focus on how she's shifted from wanting something so badly for herself and her own sake to wanting something so badly for both her own and others' sakes?  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Okay back to the fact that sky politics should be resolved through the power of nobamaki and solidify their relationship as The One for each other. Nobara provides support for maki as she needs it, and probably goes off and does stuff on her own as yuuji figures out the zodiac trials against megumi. Need to know more abt the sky politics for this I guess.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Yuki might also come into play, at least in the stsg past arc. She might also return to help resolve the sky politics threads, again helping to paint getou into a better light since they share a goal.</span></p>
