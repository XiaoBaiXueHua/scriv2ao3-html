<ul class="ul1">
  <li>ch 3 <em><span class="s1">stelliferous</span></em> (tentative) (maybe <em><span class="s1">if i could fall into the sky</span></em> if we end up regrouping café scene to 4?) opens up with the train ride and nobamaki sleepily talking about the night sky until nobara falls asleep on maki’s shoulder, leaving maki stoically keeping watch over her through the night
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>stuff they talk about will probably be little snippets of sky society, where maki slowly tries to unravel the ball of yarn cloud in her head and give details in response to nobara’s prodding</li>
    <li>at the same time, nobara’s trying to remember stuff saori told her (unbeknownst to maki that’s where she’s getting it from), maybe frames them as her own ideas?
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara might also ask why she assumed that she’d be the one using the hammer as a weapon, and this nags at maki in the back of her mind, but she can’t actually give an answer
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>should probably change that bit in chapter one where maki pulls out a knife. mai probably has all the weapons bc she’s the one who can store them using magic</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>truth be told, maki hasn’t really been remembering many concrete details about herself or anything from her past, so she’s been forced to go off of gut vibes, and that’s why she waited a while to tell nobara she feels like she’s searching for something. she just wanted to get a good handle on those vibes and how strong they were, which took a few days, until she knew for sure, because now that she has stability w/nobara, she doesn’t want to sacrifice that until she knows for sure
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>with prodding from nobara, she can kind of suss out some details, like how the strength of story and legend keeps them going, which is why “to be forgotten” is such a strong phrase to them</li>
      <li>nobara maybe asks her what she knows about the zodiac, and all maki can really come up with as an answer is that they’re guardians maybe</li>
      <li>then nobara falls asleep, and maki stares up at the sky, picking out the stars and constellations, naming them all to herself and observing the vague feelings that comes with each, which isn’t to necessarily foreshadow which emotion each of them is holding onto, but more likely to describe her relationship to them</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>anyway, then it’s onto nobara’s nitw-style hammer dream, where she’s walking around her high school, her tool belt safe and steady and comforting upon her hip, but she keeps catching flashes of whispers and such.
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>there’s a sort of rumbling that starts building up as she walks farther and farther down the hall, as the lighting grows harsher and harsher. her hands ball into fists, and she can feel the way her long nails dig into her palm like claws</li>
      <li>she hears walking from behind, and she puts a hand to where her hammer sits in its loop</li>
      <li>or okay i think that might be too on the nose, for her to start beating people’s faces in with a hammer right from the first dream. maybe she’s just walking through the empty halls with her hammer in hand, and just on a whim, she decides to smash a window in with it. and it feels good; she’s all alone, so she starts running around, doing trick shots with her hammer, pulling out nails to send them flying, too, until she stops in front of the girls’ locker room</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>maki wakes her up, still nobara’s pov, and now it’s mid-morning in tokyo, and they’re a little overwhelmed by it all, since they’ve just got the clothes on their back and a regular suitcase between them. 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara probably pops first, excited, and drags maki off on a shopping montage, maybe texting fumi in-between, though it first happens when she sees like a lil axolotl charm that reminds her of fumi and texts her a picture
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>probably at this point explicitly bring up the way nobara thinks that maki is the sky princess who has fallen to earth and forgotten everything like in the very first story saori told them bc otherwise it’s just implied n i’m not sure i want that</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>nobara realizes she didn’t bring all that much money, maki says that she has money; they pawn some of maki’s silver as nobara complains about how maki didn’t say anything earlier dammit. maki sasses her back, and they have banter like that as they walk into a store</li>
      <li>as nobara’s picking smth out for maki, maki feels a sudden draw elsewhere, quickly goes like “hey dude” and nobara’s like “what?” too busy to notice, but when maki doesn’t respond, nobara has to look up and realizes maki’s already halfway out the door, midway between running and jogging, and she goes “shit” drops everything (since she was def making maki carry everything lol) and sprints after her, yelling</li>
      <li>cue the two of them turning into an alleyway, nobara <em><span class="s1">just</span></em> as she sees maki deck some <em><span class="s1">random fucking stranger</span></em> in the chest, and like yeah, there’s a show of what is most definitely magic when that happens, but it’s not like the stranger’s just gonna be complacent so now they’re getting in a fistfight, and nobara locks eyes with the stranger’s pink-haired companion, makes a face like “ugh guess we’ll have to do this” and they pull them apart</li>
      <li>cue shouting from like. all four of them at each other at once</li>
      <li>somehow they sort it all out and they choose to head to a café. probably because yuuji’s hungry. that bastard’s stomach drives every plot tbh</li>
    </ul></li>
