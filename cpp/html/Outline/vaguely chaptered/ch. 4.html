  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>now it’s megumi’s persp of yuuji finding him, heading back, and realizing that yuuji’s grandfather died. megumi’s mostly just blank the entire time, literally having lost all his emotions, and he struggles with this because factually he knows something should be happening. but he can’t even say he feels like he should be feeling something; it’s like this disconnect btwn knowledge and emotion that’s difficult for him to parse
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>yuuji apologizes to megumi, megumi says don’t or smth. yuuji offers to let megumi stay with him for a while and megumi’s like “sure” bc what are decisions anymore. maybe brief overview of what that ends up like, or a conversation about who he is and the fact that he’s a literal fallen star. yuuji learns online that there was an unusual meteor shower the night before, comes to the conclusion that there must be other ones, and makes it his duty to help megumi reunite with them because that’s what seems right.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>yuuji’s persp(?) of the café where he outlines why they chose to come to tokyo, which truth be told are probably similar reasons to what nobara gave maki back in her hometown, except this time he actually has no ulterior motives.</li>
    <li>and yeah okay fine the chapter seems like it’s gonna be really long maybe cut it off at 5-6k if it gets there, potentially ending on the four of them just barely sorting everything out and make ch 4 stelliferous</li>
  </ul></li>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>ch 4 opens up in the café where they discuss what happens next
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>they obvs conclude that they should stay together, since if maki punching megumi means anything (and it definitely should bc that was definitely not a normal punch), then that’s just like a good idea
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>this is also where megumi speaks up and says he FEELS smth
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>yuuji goes off the shits excited bc he’s like that and nbmk are like “nani the fuck” and megumi gets to experience his newfound emotion of irritation and slaps yuuji upside the head</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>now they speculate what this means. megumi doesn’t rlly contribute to anything bc he has two settings irritated and nothing numbness. they can’t really come up with anything
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>except for maki, who’s starting to realize that the memory of megumi’s heart getting shattered is coming back to her, and she tells them kind of like, “guys. his heart’s been shattered. i returned an emotion to him because i had one of his heart shards.”
        <ul class="ul1">
          <li>nobara and yuuji don’t have the same intuition abt this as maki and it makes them have a discussion abt the spiritual heart as a center of emotion, and ofc there’s a bit like “by punching it back into him???” “i don’t fucking know!!! guess so!!!!” but eventually they all are enlightened, and yuuji’s like “oh that explains why there was that slash in his clothes riiight over his heart when i first found him!” and they’re like “omg why didn’t you tell us this”</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>from there they speculate that the draw of megumi’s emotions back to him was the searching feeling maki felt in the village (which is mostly gone now), propose the idea of just staying put in tokyo and let the others come to them, since they’ll probably be naturally drawn to megumi too right?</li>
        <li>incorrect, since the other stars have no way of actually knowing where to go but hey! worth a shot</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>they head to a hotel, realize they can only afford a two-bed one room, and sigh over that but do it anyway
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara and yuuji start looking for cheap apartments to make base in, otherwise not really thinking much of finances bc for the time being, they can live off what maki and megumi have, while megumi n maki have really awkward cousin-cousin time
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>itakugi bond over being country kids, though they bicker a lot like siblings, and maybe have nobara hint towards saori. they find a place that’s a lil country, but probably closer to suburb than rural, and it becomes yuuji’s job to go scout it out in the morning bc nobara “needs her beauty sleep”</li>
        <li>during megumi and maki’s cousin-cousin time, it’s mostly just awkward silence as maki twirls a pen around, impressed by her own skill. then, after a bit, she asks megumi if the phrase prince of stars sounds familiar, which it does, and it sparks this underlying feeling of irritation in him, though he can’t really explain why. as for memories, maybe the sense that he should remember smth</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>yuuji heads out to check out the apartment/small house on his own early the next morning (bc nobara’s not an early riser if she can help it, and the stars are still night-lagged) and happens upon nanamin, who stops him when he runs by, getting the sense the he’s important
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>yuuji explains what he’s doing, nanamin is overwhelmed by Adult Instincts for the Baby Adult (or well still kid huh since age of majority in japan is 20), asks if he’s got any parents or smth to help him out, to which yuuji’s just like nope! :D and nanamin makes the calculated decision to follow him around and help out
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>the place nobara and yuuji picked out, by the way, is very unsuited it is out of their price range (which nobara didn’t judge bc she doesn’t know how much housing costs her family’s owned the same farm for generations, and yuuji didn’t judge bc he was following on the assumption that nobara knew what she was doing) and just generally not suited towards their needs, and nanamin teaches him all this. this is probs all from nanamin’s persp</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>nanamin does not go with yuuji all the way back to the hotel room, making the decision to stay back since nanamin still has all his memories (bc he did not fall, probably; he held on and managed to stay in the sky) and he knows yuuji isn’t from or related the sky in any way. this segment ends with him turning around in search of his initial target (aka junpei)
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>yuuji probably tells nanamin what he’s up to in tokyo anyway, mentioning megumi n maki, though possibly not by name. nanamin takes this information in and tells yuuji to call him if he needs any more assistance while in tokyo, suspecting that yuuji has found the prince of stars</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>meanwhile back in the hotel, maki wakes up next to nobara and remembers mai, the first real big concrete memory to come back to her, which definitely shows on her face to the point where nobara, by the time she’s awake and almost done with her morning routine (while megumi sleeps on), asks her about it
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>maki tells nobara she has a twin named mai, and possibly even that together they embodied the spirit of gemini, which firstly forces nobara to realize that her assumptions of maki (and by extension, everyone else) are literally just that: assumptions, that she’s been putting too much blind faith in the accuracy of not only her own memories, but in saori, period. and secondly, introduces the worldbuilding bit of the constellation inheritance if it wasn’t already brought up in chapter three</li>
      <li>nobara needs a bit of alone time and possibly ends up locking herself in the bathroom with her phone, switching btwn texting fumi and her notes app, where she tries to unravel her inner monologue and the Saori Business</li>
      <li>segment might end with her curling up atop the toilet with a sigh, and then yuuji coming back and banging on the door loudly announcing that he needs to piss. nobara snaps at him but lets him in</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>and then we have the rika segment :D
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>probably mostly an impressionist style, describing a bunch of overwhelming emotions and sensations. like, she’s held on for this long, she can keep herself together; someone’s going to find her, she has faith in them, but it’s just a lot, and she feels herself fading.</li>
    </ul></li>
