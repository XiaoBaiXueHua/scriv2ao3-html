<ul class="ul1">
  <li>ch 5 probably starts the junpei arc for yuuji while the other three decide to explore tokyo and kind of feel stuff out
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>start w/nobamaki segment of them stargazing the night before. nobara admits to maki a lot of stuff abt saori, says she’s not usually apologetic, but she’s sorry for making all those assumptions abt her
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>maki, curious abt this saori person, asks nobara, meaning “who is she to know all this abt sky society” but nobara takes it to mean “who is she as a person” and so nobara launches into a starry-eyed spiel abt how saori introduced her to astronomy, and how she was kind and taught her all these ladylike things, and maki just watches and listens closely bc hey it’s not quite the answer she was asking for, but she’s developed a soft spot for nobara and likes watching her talk abt things that make her happy</li>
      <li>maki’s like “she really left a strong impression on you, huh? you must like her a lot.” and nobara stops, because this is the start of her sexuality crisis, and she’s just like “… yeah.” and maki notices this and changes the subject, bringing it back to stargazing</li>
      <li>they’re in the city, so there’s barely anything to see, but it calms nobara down. she probably receives a text from fumi asking her if she’s okay, and nobara says she’s fine, there’s no need to worry about her. the lack of stars is kind of sad to maki, though, so they pretend that all the city lights are stars, and they make up shit to go with them, see if they can form constellations with the buildings, and segment ends like that.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>yuuji calls nanamin, who receives his call right as he escapes from mahito, and nanamin says he’ll be there soon. not shown will probably be nanamin returning to the sky, getting treated by shouko (telling them abt yuuji as like this weird kid on earth getting tangled up in everything probably), and coming back
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>yuuji meets junpei when waiting for nanamin<span class="Scrivener-tab-span">	</span>, probably, and they chat abt stuff idk rn. he might notice that junpei Is Not Looking So Good, but before he can ask, junpei has to leave (bc mahito is nearby), and yuuji’s left wondering what all that’s been about when nanamin comes back</li>
      <li>this time they’ve chosen a good place, nanamin tells yuuji to call his friends so that they can sign the contract, which he does (move-in day being three days from then or smth like july 15th), and that’s how they all meet nanamin and get that heart shard returned</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>currently fuzzy on when these will be divided into chapters, so just for now know that the chapter that introduces junpei ends on another saori story, this time of pisces, and it ends in tragedy. or with like, the constellation getting forgotten bc heyyyy obsolete constellations of the fish of pisces how are you??? </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>meanwhile, when on their exploration of tokyo, they meet toudou, who also picks a fight with megumi for reasons i’m not entirely sure of yet. like yeah “what’s your type” but maybe he’s trying to see if megumi’s worth getting his heart shard back. 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>they lose that fight bc although maki has the instinct to join in, neither of them have the weaponry to match toudou in battle, and maki specifically instructs nobara to say out of this, so nobara’s just watching, lowkey frozen, with her hand halfway to her hammer on her toolbelt. </li>
    <li>anyway, then toudou shakes his head, disappointed, and leaves to regroup with the kyoto kids as they’ve assembled elsewhere
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>might be just mai, and the two of them join kamo, mechamaru, miwa, and momo at a later point</li>
      <li>might also have mai present in the shadows for this fight or introduce her 
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>to introduce her would have her catch nobara off-guard, and then maki has to divide her attention btwn toudou and mai, realize that mai has all the weapons and that there’s definitely something up with her (which they might later incorrectly? speculate to be that she’s falling victim to the curses’ resentment; it takes a whole lot to do that to a zodiac bc they are iconic on earth and they do gain most of their power and ability from stories and knowledge on earth, though the events do affect that sort of stuff via magic it’s complicated), and force nobara into a situation of “fight to survive despite the hangups” or “let the past win” and for the sake of the themes, she does not get involved in the fight here. they get out of this situation by toudou declaring megumi properly defeated, and mai leaves with him</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>while nobara’s processing all that, she gets a phone call from yuuji, who tells them to come to his location bc they can sign a housing contract now, and then they go to the segment with nanamin returning the heart shard of anger
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nanamin also asks straight up if they’ve seen anyone resembling junpei [maybe not mahito? maybe just visually describing him], and this gives yuuji the chance to go “ooooh yeah i saw him nearby earlier today when i was waiting for you” and nanamin goes hmmph . </li>
      <li>nanamin explains who he is, that he trusts yuuji and nobara to do good in helping now that they know the Truth of what’s going on, and we’ll probably have megumi prince of stars confirmation here, probably in a way that makes the kids thinks that, “well, since saori’s stories aren’t all one-for-one, maybe megumi is the sky princess since he’s the one fated to become the next sky king or w/e” and that’s wrong so they’re left with a different set of incorrect puzzle pieces to squabble over. they’re also so busy being excited over this that they don’t tell him about the toudou/mai thing earlier that day, so nanamin still has no idea where the kyoto kids are, which, offscreen, probably worries utahime a lot</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>i don’t think nanamin would ask yuuji to help him out, since he considers the information to be help enough, but yuuji is very excited to help out megumi by getting heart shards, so he ends up showing for the junpei thing anyway like next chapter. he does not offer to take maki back up into the sky bc one, she’s not at risk, and two, she’s not the full constellation spirit. she needs mai before either of them can return</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>anyway, final segment will probably be itafushi bit where yuuji patches megumi up in the bathroom
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>def reference to “yo megumi! you’re looking good!” “this looks well to you?” and yuuji’s like “nah i’m playing with you let’s get you cleaned up” “i’m fine” “c’mon, man” n then megumi rolls his eyes but lets him</li>
    <li>yuuji is definitely starting to repress some of the sukuna intrusive thoughts at this point. it might be the introduction of those, actually, as caring for megumi is probably the first step in the direction of falling in love with him</li>
    <li>yuuji asks megumi how this happened, and megumi recounts his day
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>when toudou comes up, this brings them to kind of discuss intention in returning the heart shard and why some people might not want to return it. yay exposition abt sky politics and foreshadowing into getou’s motives</li>
      <li>it probably also gets yuuji asking what the zodiac’s role is in sky society. i guess might have to hold that off from chapter three in that case, or let megumi go into more detail as to how it works</li>
      <li>at some point, yuuji off-handedly mentions that megumi has very pretty eyes n really long eyelashes, and megumi either flushes, some mix of irritated and anger, but since those are probably response emotions to the core feeling of embarrassment, he probably just takes it in stride. </li>
      <li>they probably end up talking about the return of megumi’s emotions, and what yuuji did all day with nanamin. bonding over the present vs nbmk bonding over the past</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>segment ends with yuuji feeling that job well done in cleaning up megumi</li>
    <li>thinking about it, yuuji’s probably gonna have to either get megumi shirtless, or like naked or smth, to get everything but megumi does not yet have embarrassment so it means NOTHING to him until he gets embarrassment back from miwa and he lies awake at night thinking abt all the deeply mortifying things that have happened to him since meeting yuuji and regretting every single one in its own Special way</li>
  </ul></li>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>—————————————————————-</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>actually okay okay okay. during their chapter five-ish exploration of tokyo, they find inumaki, working in like a mom and pop shop, and they bring him back with them when yuuji calls and they meet nanamin
</ul>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>yuuji’s like “woah new person??”, and inumaki ends up returning to the shop he was staying at, though he takes maki with him to explain everything in more clear language. this leaves the trio alone in the hotel, and they bond like that hehehe. maki is probably invited to stay the night w/the family inumaki is staying with, and because nobara’s there now, they end up talking about their pasts through the night. </li>
    <li>bc nobara is a past-focused character, this lets us introduce tsumiki as a character, as well as start laying the foundation for fushikugi friendship. yuuji and nobara basically keep ganging up on megumi with the way they are just. constantly on the same wavelength, bugging him with a bunch of questions abt life in the sky. megumi is, naturally, very irritated, and right as he’s about to snap at them, the power goes out</li>
    <li>nobara pulls a flashlight out of her bag, and they play shadow puppets, which results in the divine dog reveal</li>
    <li>this may or may not lead them through a midnight city adventure where at some point nobara makes them look up at the sky and see all the stars through the blackout, resulting in them finding the shard of devotion, although megumi doesn’t know what it’s called yet. </li>
  </ul></li>
