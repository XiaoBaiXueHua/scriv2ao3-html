  <li>ch 6? <em><span class="s1">the moon sees someone i want to see</span></em>(?) might introduce kyoto kids persp
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>yuuji has his junpei adventure w/nanamin while megumi and the girls have move-in day. mahito gets away once again, but they manage to save junpei at least, and they get him back to megumi to return the shard of regret. nanamin takes junpei back into the sky</li>
    <li>as like just a side note megumi’s straight up not having a good time lately, since all he’s got in terms of emotions are “irritation,” “anger,” and “regret.” like he regrets lashing out at times at the girls and probably apologizes, but they’re kind of w/e abt it bc they understand it’s not rlly his fault</li>
    <li>meanwhile, toudou and mai find miwa working at a fucking fast food restaurant, and when her shift is over, she takes them back to kyoto kid base where she, kamo, momo, and mechamaru have been living
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>miwa is working because they need money and she is their most hireable :D</li>
      <li>anyway, mai tells the group abt nobara, and they find it a bit odd that megumi’s hanging out with like a normal human girl like c’mon she didn’t even fight what was with that? ugh maki fuck maki</li>
      <li>miwa is, as always, very sweatdrop about the whole situation, bc she’d really rather just find megumi and return his heart shard so that they can focus on figuring out how to get back into the sky</li>
      <li>their discussion brings up the fact that there are a lot of heart shards left unaccounted for. like, there are the six of them plus maki, but even that’s only half the zodiac. there’s still junpei, inumaki, miminana, nanami, and ofc yuuta
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>someone probably brings up the fact that nanami is a very responsible adult who might not have been pushed out/fallen, or maybe not everyone in the zodiac got a heart shard. </li>
        <li>maki scoffs at that last bit, thinking that bc maki let go of her hand, she didn’t have a heart shard with her when she landed on earth, so she vouches for this idea</li>
        <li>any discussion of yuuta probably also brings up rika</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>anyway, their final conclusion is pretty much lie low and survive, probably stakeout what’s going on with the tokyo kids, for lack of a better group name for them, or search for the other heart shards for safekeeping</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>panda shows up on the tokyo kids’ back doorstep the morning after they move in
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara finds him all like “waaah a panda?? what’s he doing here?” and runs upstairs to wake up maki, who’s just like “oh, panda. it’s you.” and nobara’s like “YOU KNOW THIS THING???” and panda’s like “hullo it is me the bear in the sky” and nobara’s like “wait so you were a constellation too?” “hoho yes” “which one?” “i think it should be obvious.” “ohhh ursa minor!” “ursa major but yes.” </li>
      <li>they bring him upstairs to where megumi is still asleep, and panda returns the heart shard of calm/relief. this wakes megumi up, and my god at last a positive emotion holy fuck</li>
      <li>anyway, this brings up the discussion of the fact that it’s not only the zodiac members who fell after the heart shards</li>
      <li>maki also asks panda if he knows where inumaki is, but panda unfortunately does not</li>
      <li>nobara keeps finding her thoughts drifting back to saori</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>yuuji comes back, he and megumi do their thing. might be the first appearance of megumi shining again bc of the return of his emotions is letting that start to happen again, but yuuji doesn’t notice bc 1. it’s dim and 2. he’s the one being cared for this time. the kyoto kids might shine from time to time in their discussion, since they’re still mostly nocturnal i’m guessing, but it’s mostly described as like “a flash of anger” kind of thing. ambiguous. </li>
    <li>while maki and panda catch up, nobara retreats into her room and comes out as queer to fumi maybe? fumi definitely updates her abt life in the village, might be the first time it’s brought up that things are different for her now that nobara’s gone</li>
    <li>might end with maki coming back to nobara’s room, since they share it and stuff (just not the bed anymore i’m guessing), and they end up talking. nobara about fumi and how she’s being treated differently now that she’s gone, and maki tells her about her own shitty family and how she plans to stick it to them (maybe?), and we get the iconic “i respect you maki” and maki talks a little bit more abt mai and how even though gemini are the twins, it’s still very rare for two people to have the same zodiac spirit. probably explicitly details why she wears her glasses (lets her see in the night) and explains that mai has all the magic, which still isn’t much, but it’s why she needs weapons, which she can’t access rn bc mai has them! wow! 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara’s like “hmm. smth tells me that we need to get mai on our side”</li>
    </ul></li>
