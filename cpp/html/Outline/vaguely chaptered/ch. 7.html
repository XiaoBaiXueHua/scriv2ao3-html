  <li>then ch 7? these feel like super duper long chapters wtf. 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>anyway, maybe now we get mahito’s persp as he returns weak and weary to curse hq and we get an introduction to getou, who has made his way there although he’s not mentioned by name. mahito is taught how to possess a heart shard. 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>mahito might be aware of getou (i mean like why wouldn’t he if the curses do plan attacks on the sky from time to time and then they get eaten by the fucking sun) and go, “say, aren’t you with <em><span class="s1">them</span></em>?” and getou chuckles and says not to worry about it. mahito just shrugs and is like whatever~~</li>
      <li>since we have a persp of a curse here, maybe also bring up sukuna? and mahito go, “oh, yeah, naturally. who could forget about him? we came down here since the heart shattering is a good time to bring him back and then we can have our revenge blah blah blah” maybe that’s what gets getou to teach him to possess a shard idk</li>
    </ul></li>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li>maybe have a short timeskip after (the second years return to the house)? give them some fucking downtime so that they can realize, “all right, it seems that just staying in one place is Not actually doing it. we might actually have to go out and search”
</ul>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>wait fuck hmm they’ve already met toudou and mai so what ARE they waiting for at that point? idk probably if anything else comes for them bc panda worked</li>
    <li>maybe it’ll be a chapter of just dreams after that. who knows. </li>
    <li>i think it’d also be funny if they started running out of funds, and maki is just like, “guys. i think we need to get jobs.” or smth like that, and they end up doing more young adult stuff like that</li>
    <li>i think we really will have to switch to mahito/curses to get some exposition on them. it’ll probably be a good time to remind the readers of rika, too, who may have found her way to the Lair. or was found and brought there. </li>
    <li>from there, maybe kyoto kids segment where they talk about all the heart shards and stuff? </li>
    <li>thinking abt it, getou probably only exorcises one of the heart shards before megumi’s memory returns bc then i can introduce gojou and have that backstory arc and explain where the fuck he’s been this whole time</li>
  </ul></li>
