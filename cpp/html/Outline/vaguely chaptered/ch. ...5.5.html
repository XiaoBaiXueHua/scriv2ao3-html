  <li>then we get junpei chapter while nobara, maki, megumi, and inumaki have move-in day
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>maki asks them what they did when she and inumaki were gone, nobara’s just like “oh, megumi summoned some shadow dogs and we found some heart shards” and is like “oh right. that’s an important thing.” and they consider using the divine dogs to start sniffing out the heart shards, though it only works on ones that aren’t being guarded by anyone or anything, since those are the only ones with like, majority-megumi scent or w/e. but they can’t do it now bc they need to finish moving in. and also running around getting this place furnished bc they’re stupid</li>
    <li>probably going to wanna have fushikugi one-on-one bonding time afterwards tho bc maki’s having fun hanging out w/inumaki. nobara probably asks her if she remembers anything else later that night, but for the moment, fushikugi bonding. over what i’m not sure bc yuuji’s not dead. 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>okay. maybe since megumi’s received curiosity from inumaki at this point, he asks her abt saori, which is a different experience for her now that she’s realizing she’s long since had feelings for saori. megumi listens quietly, but when it seems like she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore, he might switch the subject to the fact that yuuji’s still not back. is he gonna have to share a room with inumaki? he’s not sure how he feels about that. nobara asks him how he feels about feelings in general rn, and he just kind of shrugs. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>yuuji probably doesn’t return with nanamin and junpei until the next day though so that they can find panda on the back doorstep the next morning, and then nanamin brings him, inumaki, and junpei back into the sky. panda and inumaki go to chill with tsumiki and update her on megumi, while junpei sets out on his lobbying quest of “fuck getou”</li>
    <li>maybe end the chapter on toji persp? have him go, “oh, right. i had children at some point.” <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>he doesn’t go after megumi until after he sees gojou again tho. need to figure out why</li>
    <li>that, or end the chapter on mahito’s persp pafhasd idk anymore this version of the ch feels a lot weaker than the previous one, so i might combine them together by having them meet toudou and mai when going out to buy stuff for the House They Are Renting. toudou probably doesn’t ask nobara for her type, since she’s not considered to be part of the party at that point. 
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>nobara would like, file away megumi’s type away in her head, and she makes the decision not to bug him abt it bc pfft who could that apply to, <strong><span class="s1">until</span></strong> later that evening when she sees yuuji and megumi fuss over each other’s wounds and goes, “oh?”</li>
      <li>will definitely have to split that monster of a chapter if i combine these ideas</li>
    </ul></li>
