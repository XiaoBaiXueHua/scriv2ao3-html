<ul class="ul1">
  <li>omegaverse, bc it can make explicit some of the more… i suppose unspoken aspects of the discussion of violence around gender roles? the parts about the inherent violence of gender roles that we can often feel too ashamed to speak out loud bc they just <em><span class="s1">Sound Dumb</span></em>. 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>like. not 2 psychoanalyze myself in the notes of a fic i may or may not write as if it’s a diary But. i think part of the reason i find “mating cycles/in heat” as a trope so compelling is bc i guess i have like. this lizard-brain fear of the biological imperative to reproduce that intersects with my sex repulsion, and so turning that biological imperative into a predictable, Known thing through heat cycles eliminates some of that fear bc, well. now i can control it through characters who know they must submit to it.
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>and it feels <em><span class="s1">good</span></em> to submit?? which is kind of just another thing that’s scary about it tbh, that it feels good to surrender one’s personal agency and submit to something else, bc that someone else Knows More than you, and so to surrender one’s agency also means to surrender one’s fear of the unknown.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>might also be the part where venti’s like “not to sound ungrateful or anything but how come i’m always the one on the bottom?”</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>wing kink, bc xv has none that are well written, and they can Both have wings depending on the situation</li>
  <li>ofc there’s gonna be some kind of bdsm in here there’s kind of a lot to unpack with the submission thing i talked about under the omegaverse bullet</li>
  <li>smth i do also feel obligated to cover in this fic <em><span class="s1">would</span></em> indeed be <strong><span class="s2">rape kink</span></strong>. partly bc rapey vibes were honestly so common in yaoi back in the day that it was (and might still be??) one of the most common anti-fujoshi sentiments expressed. 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>but also like. there’s that one time i read that meta about some yaoi manga i’ve never read before that was on my dash, and it talked about how like. (again with the surrender of agency thing lol) it can feel good to have someone else tell you smth about yourself that you then realize to be true or whatever i should dig that meta up again</li>
    <li>but <em><span class="s1">although i am committed</span></em> to writing bad and ooc xv smut for this fic, i um! i think i draw the line at portraying rape btwn them!! at the very least, i draw the line where xiao is lucid for it</li>
    <li>so the idea in mind for this one would be to write the lead-in, and still let it be very intense, but then basically the second venti is pinned down and unable to escape, that particular oneshot just ends. no sex or even nudity!
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>and then in the notes it would just be like:</li>
      <li>&#60;code&#62;&#60;strong&#62;venti:&#60;/strong&#62; you stopped writing.&#60;/code&#62;<br />&#60;strong&#62;istaroth:&#60;/strong&#62;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#60;strong&#62;istaroth:&#60;/strong&#62; it doesn’t make me happy.<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#38;nbsp;<br />&#60;code&#62;&#60;strong&#62;venti:&#60;/strong&#62; i&#38;hellip; don’t think this is something xiao would do anyway.&#60;/code&#62;</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>i would LOVE to figure out how to portray istaroth deleting the chapter without, like, <em><span class="s1">actually deleting the chapter</span></em>, but my only idea for handling that rn would be to then strikethrough that whole chapter, but that might be kind of weird to read if you’re not there in real time</li>
    <li><em>also</em><span class="s3">. it might be interesting to have istaroth break up with her “fake boyfriend” (unless he becomes a “real boyfriend” for a while?) in the chapter after this one, basically heavily implying that he raped her in real life. (which may or may not be the reason why she merely says “it doesn’t make me happy”)</span></li>
    <li>alternatively, it might also show up pretty early on, and the realization that rape kink doesn’t make her happy allows someone (venti?) to guide her towards other tropes that explore a similar loss of control like omegaverse or bdsm</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>the classic old yaoi/slash trope of “first time having sex with another guy”</li>
  <li>giving venti “i could fix him” disease lol 
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>as flippantly as i word this bullet point, the venti-istaroth conversation that ensues would probably take a lot of cues from <em><span class="s1">stone butch blues</span></em>, or have the oneshot fic itself basically be an amateurish portrayal of how the butch-femme relationship followed a certain social script that was able to fulfill certain emotional needs of a stone butch</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>arranged marriage + the consummation of said arranged marriage :D
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li>again, exploration of the social pressures around women to get married, and the expectation of children that comes with that. the fear of being made to have sex with a stranger whom you are not attracted to in order to conform with those expectations and stuff</li>
    <li>but also the fantasy of your chosen partner <em><span class="s1">actually being</span></em> perfect for you in every way somehow</li>
    <li>could probably cross these two things over as well, portraying this trope at least twice where the first time venti is like nervous and afraid and probably a little reluctant to have sex, but xiao is attractive so he doesn’t Actually resist. also the medieval ideas of how you’re supposed to just kinda get straight into penetration and the first time is gonna hurt a little, and you might also cry, but don’t worry it gets better as you go on~ so it’s not bad; venti still has a net good time, but it still feels kind of tragic that he has to experience that kind of pain and anxiety in the first place, just seemingly inevitably
    <ul class="ul1">
      <li>then the second time it would be playing more into the fantasy of your matched partner being magically perfect and you guys fall in love at first sight and then have like the most unrealistically pleasurable first time sex ever lol</li>
      <li>would go more into istaroth’s practicing-a-happy-ending thing, but bc it’s still arranged, it lacks a sense of agency in a way. it’s making a power fantasy out of something that you still lowkey dread as inevitable, but hey!! happy endings c’:</li>
