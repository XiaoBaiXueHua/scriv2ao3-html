<h1>header 1</h1>
<h2>header 2</h2>
<p><big>oh shit we can have titles in here too</big></p>
<blockquote align="right">attribution</blockquote>
<blockquote>blockquote that goes on for like. a normal amount of time</blockquote>
<p>header 6</p>
<p>this is a regular paragraph yippee it has <em>italics</em> and then also <strong><em>bold italics</em></strong><em> and also just back to italics</em><strong> and then we can switch to bold </strong><strong><ins>but what if we underlined things</ins></strong> and yet for the most part we just don’t really have much of anything.</p>
<p align="center">this is centered text as a paragraph style</p>
<p align="center">and this is centered text when just doing ctrl+e</p>
<p align="right">this text is justified to the right ehe</p>
<pre>code block aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa void sanitize();
<strong>void</strong> sanitize {
	string line{“”}; //notice how these have curly quotes, which we technically can’t be using in real code
	line = ""; // these are straight quotes which get exported funny in scrivener, but not the curly ones for some reason
};
<br />
&lt;3 
<br /></pre>
<p>&lt;3 for the angle bracket replacement &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &amp; also an ampersand for good measure</p>
<p align="center"><em>what if the centered text is also all-italicized?</em></p>
<p align="right"><strong>(what if the right-aligned text is also all-bold?)</strong></p>
<p>and i guess we can just have, like. nothing regular text here again lol. but <ins>only</ins> if we have exactly one underlined thing as well.</p>
