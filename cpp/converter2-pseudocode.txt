- okay, so. we need a function that'll show all the html files and directories in a folder, and then the user can either pick A File, or navigate to A Directory 
	- "Convert these files, or navigate to sub-directory" sort of thing
	- i think at this point, it's probably also a good idea to have the user specify whether they're looking to convert in a batch or just a single file from the start. like that was a good idea the first time; let's do that
- anyway, in batch mode, you can either choose to convert all the files shown (return current directory), or navigate to a different directory, which will then do the same thing of showing you all the files n directories in that folder 
	- give them the option to either convert all of them to separate files, or into one conglomerate file 
		- if they want one conglomerate file, then also give them the option to pick the order they'll be converted in


SO OVERALL THE INTERACTION SHOULD BE:

- show all files and directories in the "html" folder 

> Options 
	1. Convert a single HTML file
	2. Convert multiple HTML files.

if 1 --> pick either a file shown, or navigate to diff directory to pick from there (rinse and repeat), then set the name, and do executor()

if 2 --> then three options:
	1. choose a different directory to look through --> rinse and repeat (if there are any subfolders in the current folder!!) (so this should be the last option?)
	2. convert all files shown w/o consideration for the subfolders
	3. convert all files shown, as well as all subfolder files 
	4. convert only some of the files shown 

	once one of these options has been selected, ask if each should be converted separately (default until later can add in the next bit as an expansion), or into a conglomerate 
		if it's a conglomerate, then ask if the files should be converted in a particular order. if yes, then let them be reordered by numbers 
			- also if a mistake was made, let them enter 'b' to go back?
	either way, the files to be converted should have their paths pushed into a vector, which then gets looped through for the names --> executor()

> anyway, then give option to loop with Y/y once done


---------

so basically, the explorer function should:
	1. show all the entries in the provided folder 
	2. offer the options 
		2.1 if chosen to look through a diff directory, then call on itself again with the new filepath
	3. return the directory entry selected?


-----
maybe instead we should just have a while loop for exploring the directory. like, if opt == 1, then while opt == 1, loop through explorer until opt !== 1 for once.
in that case, what we'd actually want explorer() to be is a VOID function which determines the value of global var opt.
